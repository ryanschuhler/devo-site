**A**s I read this passage, I am moved by the image of Paul in prison,
writing to one of the churches he has served, praying for them, missing
them, and yearning to be with them. He writes with a mixture of joy and
longing, a combination of confidence and desire. He begins his letter
with two things he wants them to know and his prayer for what God will
do in their lives. It serves as a wonderful model for my own prayers for
those I teach.

After greeting them and assuring them of his prayers on their behalf,
Paul wants to encourage them with an important truth that gives him
confidence in what God will accomplish in their lives. He affirms that
God, who has begun His good work of salvation and transformation in
them, will see it through to full completion at the day of Jesus Christ.
Paul knows that some in the church may be afraid, because he is now in
prison and unable to be with them and teach them. Paul points them to
God as the One who is working in them, assuring them that God will never
leave them or give up on what He has begun. God is their ultimate
teacher and provides the power for their transformation. I, too, need to
remember this important truth and remind those I teach of it.

Paul also reflects on his own feelings toward those he has taught and
served. His prayer for them is filled with joy because of their
partnership in the gospel, by supporting his ministry and sharing the
gospel with others. At the same time, he shares his sorrow, a yearning
to be with them that cannot be satisfied because of his imprisonment.
They are dear and precious to Paul’s heart because they have shared in
God’s grace with him, and it is hard to be apart. I have never been
imprisoned, so I can’t truly understand what Paul experienced. But I
know the sadness that fills my heart when someone who has been part of a
study group I’ve led or participated in moves away and is no longer with
us. A special affection grows as we study God’s Word together—this is a
gift from God—and we enjoy and are encouraged by it even though we know
it may not last forever. Paul assures them of his love for them, which
leads to his prayer on their behalf.

Paul’s focuses his prayer for these people he loves and longs for on
three important qualities, foundational to their continued growth
together in Christ. As in so many other passages in the gospels and
epistles, Paul lifts up a growing love as of central importance. Paul
asks God to help their love abound more and more – love for each other,
for God, and for those in need of the gospel. This is the ultimate fruit
of God’s work within us since God is love and we are called to be like
Him. But along with love, Paul also prays for their growth in knowledge
and discernment. Love needs guidance, and the Philippians still have
much to learn about God’s Word, His will, and His ways. In addition,
other writings by Paul warn of false teachers who will come and preach
things contrary to the gospel, and the church will need to know God’s
Word well enough to be able to discern truth from error.

Altogether, love, knowledge, and discernment are precious gifts from
God, enabling us to know and approve what is best (excellent) and to
become people filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through
knowing and being united with Christ, not from our own efforts. Paul’s
prayer is a wonderful model for us. As you pray for those in your group,
ask God to help their love grow more and more. Pray they will grow to
know and understand His Word well enough that they can discern truth
from error in what they hear and read. Pray that as God answers these
prayers, it results in their growth in righteousness and dependence on
Christ.

Our goal in all of this is the glory and praise of God, who accomplishes
this wonderful work of transformation in us, completing it when we are
united with Christ. We won’t see the final result in this life, but God
is at work, and we have confidence that He will see it through to the
end. This gives us hope and helps us persevere in any challenges we
face, even separation due to imprisonment.

> and those who need the gospel would grow in response to Your love for
> them. I also pray that they would grow in knowledge and discernment so
> they can faithfully follow You and approve what is good and excellent,
> knowing truth from error. Help us together to be more like Christ
> because of Your transforming work within us. In all of this I give You
> praise and thanks! Amen.*
