#DEVOTIONAL 14

**Be Strong and Courageous**

> *Be strong and courageous, for you shall cause this people to inherit
> the land that I swore to their fathers to give them. Only be strong
> and very courageous, being careful to do according to all the law that
> Moses my servant commanded you. Do not turn from it to the right hand
> or to the left, that you may have good success wherever you go. This
> Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall
> meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do
> according to all that is written in it. For then you will make your
> way prosperous, and then you will have good success. Have I not
> commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be frightened, and do
> not be dismayed, for the LORD your God is with you wherever you go.”*
> (Joshua 1:6-9 ESV)

**A** temptation I sometimes face is thinking that because I understand
a passage and have a general idea of how it applies in my life, I know
it well enough to move on to something new. I’ve replaced the goal of
obedience with an easier one of understanding. I congratulate myself for
having understood the passage and for the desire to live it out, as if
that were enough. I’m afraid that a lot of our teaching in the church
unintentionally reinforces this kind of perspective. We study a Bible
passage, reflect on its application, pray together, and then leave our
group to go our separate ways. When we regather in another week or so,
we don’t often continue to reflect on the lesson of the previous week,
but we move on to something new. Our knowledge and understanding of
Scripture may be growing, but it’s not being matched by transformation
and increased obedience.

In this passage, Joshua had recently become the leader of the nation of
Israel as they were preparing to enter the land promised to them by God.
God urges him to have the strength and courage needed to obey what God
has commanded. It’s not going to be easy, and there will be times that
Joshua will be discouraged and afraid, so God urges him to be strong and
courageous. To do this, God turns Joshua’s attention back to the Law
that He had given to Moses as a sure guide for him and for the nation.
God’s desire is that Joshua not just know and understand the Law, but to
live it out. He is “to do according to all the Law that Moses my servant
commanded you.” To accomplish this, God urges Joshua to “meditate on it
day and night, so that you may be careful to do according to all that is
written in it.”

When I know that I will be leading a Bible study group, something I have
learned is not to rush the preparation shortly before the lesson, but to
spread it out over several days, taking the first two to three days
simply to read the passage(s) over and over, asking God to teach me
through them, and to meditate on them. This provides an opportunity for
God to show me what is important for myself, and what is important for
those I will lead through the study. The meaning of the passage may be
clear, but its significance for us in this time and place may not be,
and I need God’s help for discernment. I read, meditate, and pray that
the Holy Spirit would take this “living Word” and use it for God’s
purposes for His people today, myself included.

In your own Bible study leadership, are you rushing your preparation? I
once knew a man who first read through his Bible lesson on the morning
that he was to teach the children’s Sunday School class. How sad! His
teaching had simply turned into a task to accomplish, rather than an
opportunity for God to teach *him* and then use him to help the children
more fully know God’s desire for *them* and how to walk with Him more
closely. Instead of rushing the preparation, I like to think of reading
and meditation over a few days as “marinating” in God’s Word, letting it
sink in and impact me more deeply over time. I love to cook on the
grill, and we often marinate the meat for a couple of days, allowing the
flavors to penetrate the meat. In the same way, as you read, reread, and
meditate on the passage you will be studying with your group, invite the
Holy Spirit to show you the relevance and implications of those
Scriptures for you, then for those you will teach. This approach may
deepen the impact of your lesson as God uses your extended time in the
Scriptures to guide your preparation.

God affirms that the success of Joshua’s endeavors depends not only on
His knowledge of, but on his obedience to God’s instruction. God has
given him clear, trustworthy, guidance, and though Joshua’s
circumstances may feel stressful, God assures him that all will be well
because He Himself with be with Joshua, wherever he goes. This promise
applies to us as teachers, as well. God has given us not only
instruction through His Word, He has also given us Himself. He is with
us as we study the Scriptures with others, able to help us understand
and apply what we learn. For this reason, Joshua could be strong and
courageous instead of frightened or dismayed. It gives us strength and
courage for our teaching ministries as well.

> *Thank you, Father, for giving me your Word to guide me in my walk
> with you. Even more importantly, thank you for your presence with me
> as I study your Word, as I prepare my lessons, and as I lead my study
> group. May I learn how to meditate on your Word so you can teach and
> transform me, and help me better understand the significance of the
> Scriptures for those I teach. In addition, may your presence with me
> give me courage and strength for the task of teaching, knowing that
> you are at work among us for our good! Amen.*
