**Written on Our Hearts**

> *“Behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when I will make a
> new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah, not like
> the covenant that I made with their fathers on the day when I took
> them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, my covenant
> that they broke, though I was their husband, declares the LORD. For
> this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after
> those days, declares the LORD: I will put my law within them, and I
> will write it on their hearts. And I will be their God, and they shall
> be my people. And no longer shall each one teach his neighbor and each
> his brother, saying, ‘Know the LORD,’ for they shall all know me, from
> the least of them to the greatest, declares the LORD. For I will
> forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.”*
> (Jeremiah 31:31-34, ESV)

**T**his passage offers a beautiful picture of God’s loving perseverance
with His chosen people and His persistent faithfulness to His covenant
with them, even though they had broken it. God acknowledges their
unfaithfulness, but goes on to describe a better future, one where His
law is no longer something external that must be learned and obeyed, but
rather an internal reality and influence that shapes their behavior.

One of my dear colleagues, now deceased, was Robert Saucy. He served as
a theology professor at my seminary for almost fifty years. For most of
the last decade of his life he worked on his final book, *Minding the
Heart: The Way of Spiritual Transformation* (Kregel, 2013). This book
offers a biblical theology of the “heart” and explains how spiritual
growth and transformation takes place. During those years I would often
meet him on campus and talk with him about this project, and share how
eager I was to read it once he completed it. I had talked with Bob
enough to understand that, in the Bible, the heart represents us as
whole persons. It includes aspects we are aware of, as well as hidden
aspects only God knows. The heart is the center of both our thoughts and
emotions, and it is where God works to transform us. I love his book,
and I am grateful for the time he invested in this writing project.

When God speaks through Jeremiah describing the new covenant He is going
to make with His people in the future, He focuses on how their
relationship with Him and with the Law will be different. God Himself
will “write it on their hearts,” making the Law an internal guide,
something with power to shape their attitudes and actions. In addition,
everyone will know God and will not need to be taught about Him. We, as
Bible study leaders, long for this! We want to teach the Bible in ways
that God can use to impact the inner person, the *heart* of those we
teach, so that God’s Word becomes a powerful force in their lives. “I
have stored up your word in my heart, that I might not sin against you,”
says the Psalmist (Psalm 119:11). In addition, we want those we teach to
get to know God Himself, not just His Law. We want them to know God as
righteous and as loving, merciful and gracious; that He is able and
willing to forgive their sin and that He does not hold onto their
failures, but remembers their sin no more.

When Jesus celebrated the Passover meal with His disciples, He took the
cup and said, “This is my blood of the covenant which is poured out for
many for the forgiveness of sins” (Matthew 26:28). He was fulfilling the
promise made in the book of Jeremiah, signaling the beginning of this
new covenant, based on His death on our behalf, that our sins may be
forgiven. In addition, in sending the Holy Spirit to indwell those who
have placed their faith in Him, He works powerfully within us to take
the Scripture and infuse it into our hearts. As a Bible study leader, I
pray that the Holy Spirit would take the Scriptures we study, and use
them to bring about a transformation of our hearts that leads to greater
knowledge, love, and obedience to God. I recognize my own need for
continual heart transformation, and long to see this happen with those I
teach.

We are living in the “already and not yet.” God has brought about His
new covenant with all those who place their faith in Christ. His
transforming work has begun in our hearts, but it is not yet complete.
For this reason we lead Bible studies – that God may take His Scripture
and write it deeper and deeper into our hearts, so that what flows from
our lives reflects our increasing knowledge of Him, love for Him, and
obedience to Him. Someday, when Christ returns, the need for our
teaching efforts will end. We will be like Christ because He will
complete His transforming work in us, and we will all know God fully and
not need to be taught about Him. Until that day, we continue to lead
Bible studies, and we pray for the Holy Spirit to continue His
transforming work. Thank you for your investment in leading others in
the study of God’s Word. May God use your teaching in powerful ways,
through His Spirit!
