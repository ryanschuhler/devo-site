I love studying the Bible and teaching it to others. There is a joy
in understanding a passage and helping others understand it well, too.
It’s exciting when someone has an “Aha!” moment and comprehends an
important truth from Scripture. But, as exciting and enjoyable as these
experiences may be, they can actually make us miss God’s greater
purposes in giving us the Scriptures, and our teaching can become a
danger to our souls and to those we teach.

As I read over this brief description of Ezra and what he set his heart
to accomplish, I am encouraged and challenged by how he approached his
task. It causes me to wonder how well I am doing with the teaching
responsibilities God has given me. From what this passage shows, it
seems there are a couple of temptations I should watch out for,
temptations that Ezra appears to have successfully avoided.

It says that “Ezra had set his heart to study the Law of the LORD, and
to do it and to teach his statutes and rules in Israel” (vs. 10). The
first temptation I recognize for me is one of studying the Scriptures
just so I will know it well and be thought of as a knowledgeable Bible
teacher. There is a subtle temptation to pride as we study the
Scriptures. Helmut Thielicke, a theologian writing in the 1960s
understood this temptation and warned against it when he wrote:

> Truth seduces us very easily into a kind of joy of possession: I have
> comprehended this and that, learned it, understood it. Knowledge is
> power. I am therefore more than the other man who does not know this
> and that. I have greater possibilities and also greater temptations.\
>
> (A Little Exercise for Young Theologians, Eerdmans, 1962, p. 16.)

Increased knowledge of the Scriptures can lead to pride, particularly if
our main aim is to understand and use our knowledge to lift up ourselves
over others. There is status in being a teacher, and we have to guard
our hearts so that this does not become our goal of study. Ezra avoided
this first temptation. He was not content just to know God’s Word, he
committed himself to do it, to live it out, to allow God to teach him
what it means to *follow* His instruction, not just to *know* it. Ezra
demonstrates a teachable spirit, a willingness to obey God even when it
is hard. He did this as part of equipping himself to teach others.

This highlights the second temptation I face, at times, as I teach. When
I prepare a Bible study for a group, it can be easy for me to focus on
what I have come to call “second-hand truth,” giving attention to the
lessons in Scripture that my group needs to hear and respond to, but
somehow thinking they don’t need to apply to me, or that I can teach
them just because I understand them. But God really wants to teach me
first, to work His truth into my heart and life, so that when I teach, I
can share from my own experience how good God’s will is. God wants me to
learn and grow first before I teach, so I have “first-hand truths” to
share, and *then* I can encourage those whom I teach to see how good
God’s teaching is, even if it is not always easy to put into practice.

I want to be more like Ezra, and I pray that God will help me. Ezra
seems to have escaped these two temptations we may face as Bible
teachers. He was skilled in his understanding of the Scriptures, and he
used these skills to study God’s Word to understand what God desired of
His people. He also set his heart to *do* and to *live out* what he
learned from God, not just to understand it. Then he set his heart to
teach God’s statutes to God’s people. This is a powerful combination—one
God can use to transform us as we prepare to teach, and then transform
those who join us in learning from God through His Word!

> Father God, help me never to be content with merely knowing your
> Scriptures well. Keep me from the temptation of the pride of
> knowledge. Help me desire to live out what I learn from you in your
> Word before I attempt to teach it to others. May you be my teacher,
> and may I be “first learner” as I carry out the teaching
> responsibilities you have given me. Please bless my teaching ministry.
> May your “good hand” be upon me. May you be glorified as I teach, and
> may your Holy Spirit work in me, and in those I teach, so that our
> hearts and actions better fit your desires for us, and please you.
> Save us from anything less. Amen.
