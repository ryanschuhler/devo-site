> Now the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain to which

I don’t know what it is like for you, but there are times when I am
preparing a Bible study, or I’m in the middle of teaching one, and
inside of me the thought occurs, “Who do you think you are to teach the
Bible? With all your failures and failings, don’t you think you should
leave this to someone else, someone more qualified?” These thoughts
trouble me, and it can be difficult to work through them, especially if
I’m feeling at all discouraged about how my teaching is going. I’m so
intimately familiar with my own limitations and sin nature, that it
seems ridiculous to think I am up to the task of teaching God’s Word.
But it helps me to see how Jesus called and used others with their own
limitations and failings.

I love this passage at the end of the Matthew’s Gospel. It is such a
powerful and hope-filled encouragement to my soul. Here we see Jesus,
after His resurrection, gathering his eleven disciples in Galilee to
commission them to their future ministries. These are the same disciples
who misunderstood the nature of His kingdom, who argued about who would
be the greatest in His kingdom, who fled when He was arrested, and who
hid in fear after His death. Even now, as they gathered around the
resurrected Jesus, it says that some doubted. They’ve got Jesus right in
front of them, and some doubted. Yet, Jesus tells them that because He
has all authority in heaven and on earth, they are to go and make
disciples of all nations, baptizing people in the name of the Father,
Son, and Holy Spirit, and teaching them to observe all that He has
commanded them.

None of these disciples had earned the right to teach for Jesus. None of
them had aced the course or earned enough righteousness points to take
on the role of teacher. Instead, it is because all authority rests with
Jesus that He can call them and us to serve Him by teaching, even when
we have failed in the past and have doubts and fears in the present. It
is by His grace that we have come to saving faith in Him, and it is by
His grace that we are able to study the Scriptures and teach others what
Jesus wants taught – not because we know it so well or do it so well. It
is humbling and amazing to think that God could entrust those eleven
disciples back then, and people like you and me today, to go and make
disciples and to teach them all that Jesus commanded. Recognizing this
“Great Commission” that Jesus entrusted us with motivates me to do my
very best, knowing that ultimately, the Holy Spirit is the One who
teaches us all through God’s Word.

This passage highlights one more thing that is so very important for me,
as well. Teaching can be a very lonely experience at times. Most often
we study on our own to lead a Bible study. When we lead, we commonly do
so as the primary leader of the group, responsible for how the study
goes. We don’t often spend a lot of time with others who are leading
other Bible study groups, so we may feel pretty isolated, like we are on
our own. But Jesus reassures His disciples that as they carry out this
ministry of making disciples, baptizing them, and teaching them, they
are not alone. He says, “I am with you always, to the end of the age.”
This had to be a comfort to them, even as they may later have grieved
His leaving them as He ascends to heaven.

The end of the age has not yet come, and the ministry of making
disciples, baptizing and teaching them continues. Like the disciples in
the past, God continues to call people like you and me, unworthy yet
given grace for the task, to this same ministry. In doing so, He
promises that we are never alone, that He is always with us, and we
always have the ability to reach out to Him for more grace, wisdom,
discernment, and strength for the ministries He calls us to.

As you continue to reflect on this wonderful, foundational passage for
our Bible study ministries, give thanks to God for the gospel, for His
amazing grace that saved you, and that same grace that sustains you as
you make disciples, baptize them, and teach them all that Jesus has
commanded. Know that Jesus is with you, always and everywhere, even to
the end of the age! You are never alone as you teach. May your awareness
of His presence grow and encourage you as you serve!
