# DEVOTIONAL 13

**The Power of the Living Word of God**

> *For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged
> sword, piercing to the division of soul and of spirit, of joints and
> of marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart.
> And no creature is hidden from his sight, but all are naked and
> exposed to the eyes of him to whom we must give account.* (Hebrews
> 4:12-13, ESV)

**I**s leading a Bible study like leading any other “book club”
discussion? Do we gather to talk about our take on the book, what we
like or don’t like, what we agree with or disagree with, our
interpretation of what the author is saying, or what else it reminds us
of? If we view the Bible as being like any other book, our group studies
can easily turn into this kind of experience. But the Bible is *not*
like any other book, and our discussion of a passage needs to reflect
our understanding of how God uses the unique nature of the Bible for our
spiritual growth.

As we study the Scripture in order to lead our Bible study group, and as
we gather together in that group study time, something happens that
differs from any other “book club” gathering. As important as it is,
it’s not only that the Bible is unique as God’s revelation of Himself to
us. As Christians, when we study the Bible with an open heart, God, the
Holy Spirit, is present with us, actively using the Scriptures to probe
our hearts and minds, bringing insights, showing implications for our
lives, and convicting us of our need to respond in obedience. The writer
of Hebrews calls God’s Word “living and active,” and it is, in the hands
of the Holy Spirit who resides within us. This should make all the
difference in how we approach our study together, and it should also
impact how we prepare to lead and teach.

So many times, in preparation for leading a Bible study session, as I’ve
read and studied a Scripture passage, the Holy Spirit has brought
certain aspects of the passage to my attention, helping me see something
I need to respond to. Sometimes providing encouragement, conviction of
sin, or the need to be obedient to His prompting, the Spirit helps me
see my own heart and life in relation to what I’m reading. In these
ways, God’s Word pierces straight to my heart, reveals its condition and
works to renovate it to be more like God’s own heart. Sometimes the
Spirit convicts me of things I’ve already recognized but need His help
to address. But other times, He shows me something I haven’t recognized
about myself, bringing new recognition of a need for repentance and a
change in my behavior. This all happens because the Holy Spirit is
present as I read and study God’s Word.

Recognizing this truth about how God works through His Word in our
lives, it needs to impact the way I teach, as well. As I lead a Bible
study, I want to lead the group to invite God, through the Holy Spirit,
to be present and to help us attend to His work in us as we study His
Word. I want God to use His Word to probe our hearts, not just inform
our heads. As we grow in our understanding of what the Scripture says
and means, we pray and ask for God’s help to discern how it applies to
us, what He desires of us, and ways in which the message of this passage
needs to impact our lives. We are not content merely to know what the
Bible says and means; we want God to use it to grow, mature, and shape
us more into the image of Christ. Our teaching must encourage this
deeper reflection and attention to God in the midst of our study, and
provide time to consider and share the implications He is helping us see
for our lives. It’s a process that takes time, prayer, and conversation
together. If we truly want to grow spiritually, it is time well spent.

Finally, the next time we gather it can be encouraging if we take time
for group members to share where God gave them opportunities to live out
what we were learning in the previous study. This sharing helps create
an expectation of God’s work in our lives, and testimonies to God’s
gracious work always encourage the heart, leading us to praise Him
together. It helps us realize that God’s living word not only has power
to show us our need, in God’s hands it has power to transform us!

The end of this passage highlights God’s intimate and exhaustive
knowledge of us. We can neither hide from nor fool Him. He knows us
better than we know ourselves. So, as we study, let us ask God to show
us ourselves as He sees us, that we can see where we need to change and
grow, and let us invite Him to lead us through that transformation. As
the Psalmist wrote:

> *Search me, O God, and know my heart!*
>
> *Try me and know my thoughts!*
>
> *And see if there be any grievous way in me,*
>
> *And lead me in the way everlasting!*
>
> (Psalm 139:23-24, ESV)
>
> *Father, I am grateful for Your Living Word and its power to help me
> see my need for repentance, forgiveness, and transformation by Your
> Holy Spirit. Please use Your Word as an instrument to show me, and my
> group, where we need to grow. Encourage us through Your Word as we
> reflect on your amazing steadfast love for us, your mercy and grace to
> us, and your powerful work in us through Your Spirit. Discipline us in
> your love, reassure us with your presence, and lead us in your
> everlasting way! Amen.*
