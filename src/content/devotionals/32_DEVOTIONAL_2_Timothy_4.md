**Fulfilling Your Ministry**

> *I charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who is to
> judge the living and the dead, and by his appearing and his kingdom:
> preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove,
> rebuke, and exhort, with complete patience and teaching. For the time
> is coming when people will not endure sound teaching, but having
> itching ears they will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit
> their own passions, and will turn away from listening to the truth and
> wander off into myths. As for you, always be sober-minded, endure
> suffering, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry.* (2
> Timothy 4:1-5, ESV)

**I** have often heard it said that the way to equip yourself to spot
counterfeit money is to spend time closely examining the real thing. The
idea is that the more you take the time to study the details of a real
$20 bill, the easier it is to notice when someone hands you a fake. I
think this strategy for spotting counterfeit money fits well with Paul’s
instructions to Timothy. How do you help people spot a false teaching?
Immerse them well in the message of the Scriptures. Taking time to help
people know the Bible well, and allowing it to challenge and change
them, helps equip them to discern when a particular teaching is wrong.

Since Paul is in prison, he cannot come to help the church in Ephesus.
Timothy is there to lead the church and continue the teaching ministry
that Paul can no longer carry out in person. Paul knows there will be
false teachers in Ephesus who will attempt to gather a following and
lead people away from the gospel message. Paul sends a letter to
Timothy, with a strategy for countering the misleading teaching. He
encourages Timothy to immerse the people in the “real thing”, preaching
the word and being ready at all times to do so. Timothy is to rebuke
wrong understanding and behavior in light of what Scripture teaches, and
to offer encouragement where the people’s understanding and behavior fit
well with God’s Word. Both correction and encouragement are important
aspects of our study of the Bible together. We study the Scriptures to
correct *our* misunderstandings and misbehavior and to encourage others’
positive steps in the right direction.

Paul also encourages Timothy to be patient, taking time to teach, not
just lecture the people. God, over time, uses patient, persistent
instruction to impact people’s minds and hearts as they reflect on how
their understanding in the past has shaped their behavior, and what God
desires of and for them now. In Romans 12:2, Paul highlights the
importance of not being conformed to this world, but being transformed
by the renewal of our minds. In his letter to Timothy, Paul urges him to
help renew the minds of the people in the church in Ephesus, continuing
to patiently teach God’s Word to them. As their minds are renewed, they
can more easily recognize and resist the influence of false teachers who
will attempt to lead them astray.

Paul describes how people tend to gravitate to teachers who “suit their
own passions”, which is as true today as it was in Paul’s time. We all
like a teacher we agree with and who does not challenge us to change. It
can be easy to follow a teacher who tells us we are okay and can do what
we want. It’s more challenging to be a teacher who lovingly speaks
correction, who points out where God wants to use Scripture to teach us
and grow us. Paul warns Timothy that he will also experience the same
challenge, and concludes this section with an admonition for Timothy to
keep a clear head, endure the suffering that will come, continue to
share the gospel with others, and persist in his ministry.

I don’t know what it’s like where you live, but I live in a culture
where most people think very little of God and don’t welcome correction
from God’s Word. They much prefer hearing from people who reassure them
that they do not need to change, that their beliefs and lifestyle are
fine—that they should be authentic to who they want to be. From their
perspective, there is no objective moral standard to pursue. Like
Timothy, we offer a gospel message about our sin nature and our need for
both forgiveness and transformation. Through a study of the Scriptures,
we come to understand both the righteousness of God and His great
compassion, mercy, and grace toward us through Jesus Christ. We must
continue to lead Bible studies where people can read and hear the truth
of who God is and His perspective on our lives. Then we might understand
both the grace of forgiveness through faith, and the grace of growth
through the work of the Spirit in us, as we learn and obey His teaching
in the Scriptures. Only patient and persistent instruction can help
people avoid counterfeit teaching. May God continue to use you to
strengthen the church in this way!
