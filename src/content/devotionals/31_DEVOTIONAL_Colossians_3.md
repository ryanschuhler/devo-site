**Letting the Word of Christ Dwell in You Richly**

> *Put on then, as God’s chosen ones, holy and beloved, compassionate
> hearts, kindness, humility, meekness, and patience, bearing with one
> another and, if one has a complaint against another, forgiving each
> other; as the Lord has forgiven you, so you also must forgive. And
> above all these put on love, which binds everything together in
> perfect harmony. And let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to
> which indeed you were called in one body. And be thankful. Let the
> word of Christ dwell in you richly, teaching and admonishing one
> another in all wisdom, singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs,
> with thankfulness in your hearts to God. And whatever you do, in word
> or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to
> God the Father through him.*

> (Colossians 3:12-17, ESV)

**T**he church in Colossae, like others where Paul had ministered,
comprised a very diverse group of people—Jews and Greeks, Roman citizens
and others without that status, slaves and free people, men and women.
They came from different backgrounds, but were now united in Christ.
Though all part of God’s design for the Body of Christ, this diversity
could very naturally lead to conflicts, misunderstandings,
judgmentalism, and division. Because Paul recognizes that God has chosen
them to be part of His body, he urges them to exercise patience,
kindness, humility, meekness, and to have compassion, one for another.
He also recognizes that conflicts will happen, and calls them to forgive
one another as God has forgiven them, and to put on love and let
Christ’s peace rule in their hearts, which leads to harmony in the midst
of diversity. Though written long ago, the church needs this same
message today. Too easily, our differences can drive us apart when God
wants us to be one body, living a life of love, forgiveness, and harmony
in the midst of our diversity. Paul goes on to share a means to foster
this kind of unity—that being in how we spend time together in the Word.

This passage powerfully reminds us why it is important for Christians to
study and understand the Scriptures. It is not so others will see us as
smart or knowledgeable, or to feel self-satisfaction as we figure out
difficult portions (like ciphering a mystery novel or a puzzle). Rather,
it is that we be equipped to teach and admonish one another wisely,
ministering God’s Word to one another. Dietrich Bonhoeffer, in *Life
Together* (Harper & Row, 1954), explains why God gives us His Word and
how we are to use it to support one another.

> But God has put this Word into the mouth of men in order that it may
> be communicated to other men. When one person is struck by the Word,
> he speaks it to others. God has willed that we should seek and find
> His living Word in the witness of a brother, in the mouth of man.
> Therefore, the Christian needs another Christian who speaks God’s Word
> to him. He needs him again and again when he becomes uncertain and
> discouraged, for by himself he cannot help himself without belying the
> truth. He needs his brother man as a bearer and proclaimer of the
> divine word of salvation. He needs his brother solely because of Jesus
> Christ. The Christ in his own heart is weaker than the Christ in the
> word of his brother; his own heart is uncertain, his brother’s is
> sure. (pp. 22-23)

As you lead your Bible study group, you are not merely leading them to
understand and apply Scripture in their own lives, you are equipping
them to minister God’s Word to one another. You are multiplying the
ministry of the Word, and it is important they gain a vision for how God
can use them to teach and admonish one another. Reading and reflecting
on this passage together could be a good way to start.

One powerful way that we speak God’s Word to one another is through the
songs we sing together, be it a Scripture song or other worship song
that summarize important Biblical truths. When we gather around the
Word, taking time to corporately sing psalms, hymns, and spiritual
songs, we rehearse and affirm the truths of the Word, encouraging one
another in light of these truths. Music helps us recall lyrics, helping
us to remember portions of the Bible and truths we need to live by. (For
example, how many commercial jingles do you remember from your
childhood? Advertisers know, and use, the impact of music in helping us
remember their products.) Finding and using songs that underscore the
Scripture portion your group is studying is one way to help them
remember what they have been learning, to speak these truths to one
another, and to encourage one another.

It all begins with letting the Word of Christ dwell in you richly! As
you prepare to lead your group, spend quality time in the Word and allow
God first to teach you, so that you are able to teach others from the
work God is doing in your own life. In turn, encourage your students to
let the Word dwell in them, over time shaping their understanding, their
desires, and their response in obedience. God will equip them in this
way to speak His Word to one another, planting seeds that multiply the
ministry of the Word.

> *Father, thank you for those who have spoken your Word to me,
> encouraging me to pursue the kind of unity, love, and peace you desire
> in your body. Help me to welcome your Word into my life, allowing it
> to dwell in me richly, so that I may grow to be more like your Son,
> Jesus, and be equipped to teach, admonish, and encourage others with
> your Word. May the songs we sing together, with thankful hearts,
> affirm the message of Scripture and encourage our response of
> obedience to you. Amen.*
