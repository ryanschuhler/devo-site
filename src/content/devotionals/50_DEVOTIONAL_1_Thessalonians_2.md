**Teaching Like a Mother and a Father**

> *For you yourselves know, brothers, that our coming to you was not in
> vain. But though we had already suffered and been shamefully treated
> at Philippi, as you know, we had boldness in our God to declare to you
> the gospel of God in the midst of much conflict. For our appeal does
> not spring from error or impurity or any attempt to deceive, but just
> as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel, so we
> speak, not to please man, but to please God who tests our hearts. For
> we never came with words of flattery, as you know, nor with a pretext
> for greed—God is witness. Nor did we seek glory from people, whether
> from you or from others, though we could have made demands as apostles
> of Christ. But we were gentle among you, like a nursing mother taking
> care of her own children. So, being affectionately desirous of you, we
> were ready to share with you not only the gospel of God but also our
> own selves, because you had become very dear to us.*
>
> *For you remember, brothers, our labor and toil: we worked night and
> day, that we might not be a burden to any of you, while we proclaimed
> to you the gospel of God. You are witnesses, and God also, how holy
> and righteous and blameless was our conduct toward you believers. For
> you know how, like a father with his children, we exhorted each one of
> you and encouraged you and charged you to walk in a manner worthy of
> God, who calls you into his own kingdom and glory.* (1 Thessalonians
> 2:1-12, ESV)

**P**aul knew that God had called him and his mission team to share the
gospel with others, but he also knew that some people might distrust
them, thinking they had ulterior motives for their actions. Caution was
warranted, as there were people in their society who traveled and
taught, seeking praise or profit, leading people astray and leaving them
poorer in the process. In an attempt to dispel their concerns, Paul
invites them to remember his conduct and those who served with him.
Rather than taking advantage of them, he compares his mission team to
loving parents who do all they can for the sake of their children.
Paul’s example wonderfully challenges me in my own teaching.

*Like a nursing mother.* Have you watched how a mother of an infant
picks up and cares for her child? She gently supports the baby where
needed, holds it close, soothes it if it cries, and provides what it
needs as she nurses it. In contrast to teachers who took advantage of
those they taught, Paul and his team focused on caring for the believers
in Thessalonica. Their genuine love and affection for the people led
them to share themselves with the people, not just a message. Their
teaching ministry was an act of love, not a way to make a profit or gain
praise. They worked hard, “night and day,” so that they could cover
their expenses and not become a financial burden on the believers. Paul
calls the believers to remember his team’s conduct in ministry service
there—done with pure motives, having done nothing wrong or deceptive.

*Like a father.* Paul adds to the parenting imagery by comparing his
team’s ministry to how fathers guide and encourage their children.
Paul’s team cared for the people like a nursing mother, but they also
exhorted and encouraged them in their walk with God. They challenged the
people to put into practice what they were learning from the gospel
message. Taking it a step further, Paul exhorted them to shape their
lives in a way that better reflected the character of God, who had
called them into His Kingdom for their good and for His glory.

In these images of nursing mother and father I see two major aspects of
our teaching ministries modeled for us. Like the nursing mother, we must
be gentle, especially with new believers, loving them with a patient and
generous love, sharing with them and caring for them as they grow. Like
a father, we must urge them to grow to follow God more faithfully in
their daily lives. It is not enough to “educate them” about the gospel
or how God wants us to live as those who are in Christ. What we learn
must, in turn, impact our attitudes and actions, something that doesn’t
always automatically flow from mere knowledge. We need to challenge
those we teach to live faithfully in light of what they have come to
know about God and His call to us as citizens of His Kingdom—to “walk
our talk.” Because personal change is often difficult, we must be
prepared to encourage them along the way. Our teaching must make room
for this kind of sharing and encouragement as people seek to follow God
in obedience to His Word. It takes time to change life patterns, so we
need both gentle caring and exhortation to support lasting growth.

I thank God for those who patiently and lovingly taught me the
Scriptures, both before and after I came to faith in Christ. Many people
were like “mothers” to me, sharing not only the gospel message, but
themselves as well. I have also had many “fathers,” who urged and
encouraged me beyond just knowing the truth of the Scriptures, but in
living it out daily. I am grateful for their generosity in sharing their
time and their lives with me. I hope and pray I can do the same for
others.

> *Father, thank you for the example of Paul and those who served with

> seeking to be more like you. These “mothers” and “fathers” are
> precious to me. Help me to follow in their footsteps! May my teaching
> in some way support and encourage others to walk in ways that are
> worthy of you. May this be true of me as well! Amen.*
