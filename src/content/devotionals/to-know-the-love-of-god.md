I love Paul’s prayer for the church in Ephesus. In this letter, like
his others, Paul sought to address particular challenges the church was
facing, key things they needed to understand, and ways in which their
lives needed to change to conform more fully to what God desired of
them. Paul knew that he had to address all of these important aspects,
but even more than these things, he desired something much bigger,
something more important and life-transforming for them.

Paul knew that the life of a follower of Christ was not merely about
knowing the right things (orthodoxy) and doing the right things
(orthopraxy), but being in a relationship with God where God’s power,
through the Holy Spirit, would be at work within them to strengthen them
and ground them in the love of God. He prayed that God would dwell
within them in powerful ways, the main fruit of that indwelling being
their ability to know the vastness of Christ’s love and to be filled
with the fullness of God.

Pauls’ prayer challenges me to reflect on how I tend to pray for those I
am leading in a Bible study. If I am honest with myself, much of the
time I pray that they will be open to learn, that God will use the
lesson to help them grow in faith and faithfulness to God. These are
good things to pray, and I’ve seen God answer these prayers time and
time again. However, what I don’t tend to pray is that those I teach be
rooted and grounded in love, or have the strength to comprehend the
unfathomable vastness of God’s love for them in Christ. Paul’s prayer
pushes me to consider what my prayers for my students may be lacking.

Rereading and meditating on Paul’s prayer gives me some insight into why
he believed these things were so important to pray for the church in
Ephesus, and in turn for us today. When we teach only for right beliefs
and right behaviors, people may pursue these things for a season, but
over time they may get distracted, and their convictions may fade or
weaken. We need a powerful, motivating force that enables us, over time,
to persevere in pursuing right knowledge and right behavior when things
are difficult, or when others criticize us. We need the powerful
motivation of God’s love for us, experienced through Christ, to live out
our faith well in spite of hardship or distractions. When I experience
and understand something of the immeasurable love that God has for me,
my soul responds in gratitude and obedience. As we come to know that
love, God fills us with His fullness, and we become more open to His
transforming work within us.

Paul concludes his prayer by affirming God’s ability to accomplish far
more than we can imagine as His power works within us through the Holy
Spirit. That transforming power brings about real change, and the
starting point for that change is our being rooted and grounded in God’s
love for us. When we begin to grasp that great love, it helps us respond
in kind with a love that moves us in the direction of obedience and
growth.

I remember a girl who once told me that she believed God loved everyone
else, but He did not, could not love her. I, and others, sought to love
and convince her of God’s love for her, but she did not respond. In her
inability to believe and accept God’s love for her, she gave up
following God and walked away from the youth ministry I was involved in.
I grieved her departure.

Believing in and understanding something of God’s great love for us is
foundational to our walk with God and a catalyst to spiritual growth. As
you pray for those you teach or lead in Bible study, be sure to pray as
Paul did, that they would be rooted and grounded in love, that God would
be powerfully at work within them to see that love more clearly, and
that they be open to God’s transforming work within them.

> Father, I marvel at your steadfast love for me! As I pursue Bible
> study and seek to know you better, help me to grow in my understanding
> and appreciation of the greatness of your love, and may it move me to
> love you better and follow you more fully. I pray that those I teach
> will gain more than mere knowledge and changes in behavior. May they
> grow in their experiential knowledge of your love for them, and may
> that become the power within them that accomplishes more than they can
> imagine. To you be the glory! Amen.
