**The Ministry of the Holy Spirit in Our Teaching**

> *“If you love me, you will keep my commandments. And I will ask the
> Father, and* *he will give you another Helper, to be with you forever,
> even the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it
> neither sees him nor knows him. You know him, for he dwells with you
> and will be in you…”* (John 14:15-17, ESV)
>
> *“These things I have spoken to you while I am still with you. But the
> Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will
> teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all that I have
> said to you.”* (John 14:25-26, ESV)
>
> *“Nevertheless, I tell you the truth: it is to your advantage that I
> go away, for if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you. But
> if I go, I will send him to you. And when he comes, he will convict
> the world concerning sin and righteousness and judgment . . .”* (John
> 16:7-8, ESV)
>
> *“I still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them

> hears he will speak, and he will declare to you the things that are to
> come. He will glorify me, for he will take what is mine and declare it
> to you. All that the Father has is mine; therefore I said that he will
> take what is mine and declare it to you.”* (John 16:12-15, ESV)

**H**ave you ever been preparing to lead a Bible study and struggled to
think through how to lead your group in applying the message of the
Scriptures to their lives? It’s one thing to know what a passage says
and means, it is another to discern how to live, in light of what it
teaches. This is a critical element in studying and teaching the Bible,
since our goal is not just greater knowledge, but greater faithfulness
in living out what we learn. The good news is that God has given us
tremendous help in this area!

In John 14-17, Jesus knew that the time for His death was drawing near,
yet there was still much that His disciples did not know, or simply did
not yet understand. In the above passages, Jesus reassures them that He
will not leave them alone, and that their learning and growth will
continue. With Jesus’ pending departure, He says that the Father will
send them another Helper, the Holy Spirit, also appropriately named the
“Spirit of Truth”, who will dwell within them forever. His role is to
teach them all that Jesus wants them to know, and to help them remember
what Jesus taught them. In addition, there were things they were not
ready to hear and understand during Jesus earthly ministry, but the Holy
Spirit would guide them to those important truths, glorifying Jesus as
He does so. In other passages we learn that it is the Holy Spirit who is
at work to transform us more into the image of Christ (2 Corinthians
3:18). What a wonderful gift!

This same Holy Spirit indwells believers today, and this gift can deeply
impact the way we approach leading Bible study groups. This Holy Spirit
was actively at work guiding the authors of the Scriptures so that we
might have God’s message for us today. This same Spirit dwells within us
to help us better understand how God’s Word applies in our lives,
stirring our thinking, convicting us of sin, and helping us discern
where and how we need to live out what we have learned. As a teacher, I
can seek God’s help to apply the Scriptures in my own life, I can pray
that He will be at work in the hearts of those I teach, and I can also
teach in ways that help my group be attentive to the Holy Spirit in His
convicting work.

In light of this, I find some things I need to do as I prepare my
lessons and as I teach. First, I need to take some extended time with
the passages I will teach so that I can meditate on them, pray, and
invite the Holy Spirit to teach me and give me insights as to how the
passages impact my life and the lives of those I will teach. Second, I
cannot assume I know how those I teach need to apply the truths of the
Scriptures, so I must take time to allow them to reflect and discuss
this in the group. Pray together that the Holy Spirit would give them
insights and a clearer understanding of the importance of the passages
for their lives. As different people reflect and talk, God uses this
time to stir our hearts and help us see things we may have overlooked.
So many times, I have gained important insights because of something
shared by another person in my group. Finally, I must continue to pray
for those I teach, that the Holy Spirit would remind them of what they
read and heard, so that the Spirit can continue to bring conviction
where needed, encouragement, and courage to put into practice what they
learned. The Holy Spirit’s teaching continues long after the study group
has concluded, and we can pray for His transforming work throughout the
week.

As a Bible study leader, you are not teaching alone. God is present and
working through the Spirit to teach, convict, and transform. Pray that
you will learn how to be a supportive part of that work, and continue to
seek God’s guidance as you prepare and as you teach.

> *Father God, I am so thankful that you have given us the Holy Spirit,
> the Spirit of truth, to continue Jesus’ teaching work within us. Help
> me be attentive to you as I study, so that you may convict me and
> guide me in appropriately applying what I learn from your Word. Help
> me to remember what I have learned, so that over time you can take it
> even more deeply into my own heart and transform me more fully.
> Finally, help me prepare and teach in ways that you can use to
> accomplish your purposes in our lives. Thank you for being our
> teacher. Amen.*
