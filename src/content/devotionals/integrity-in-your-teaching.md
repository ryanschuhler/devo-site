> But as for you, teach what accords with sound doctrine . . . Show

We live in an age where every idle word shared on social media or in
an email can come back to haunt us. Many politicians and celebrity
entertainers’ careers have been derailed because of something they wrote
in a moment of passion, or that they shared with a friend in what they
thought was a private conversation. When their comments became public
they received swift condemnation for their words and attitudes behind
them, marring their carefully cultivated public images. In some cases,
statements of repentance and contrition were enough to salvage their
status to some degree, but in other cases reputations were ruined, and
they have faded from the public spotlight. Though he lived before the
era of the Internet, Paul knows the potential negative impact of our
words, and he cautions us to be careful both in what we do and what we
say.

In this pastoral epistle, Paul exhorts and instructs Titus how to
respond to false teachers who are upsetting members of the church. In
the previous chapter Paul condemns their teachings, their actions, and
their selfish motivations. Here, he turns his attention to Titus and his
teaching ministry, offering some timeless guidance that applies to all
of us who teach or lead Bible studies today, specifically focusing both
on what Titus says and does. Each aspect is important for the reputation
of the gospel.

Clearly, the content of what we teach matters. In contrast to the myths
and false commands that others were teaching in opposition to the gospel
message, Titus is to teach what fits well with sound doctrine. We have
received an authoritative message in the Scriptures, and we are to share
it with others. We aren’t at liberty to make up our own doctrine that
might be popular or well received by those we teach. As Paul wrote in
Titus 1:9 about elders in the church, *“He must hold firm to the
trustworthy word as taught, so that he may be able to give instruction
in sound doctrine and also to rebuke those who contradict it.”* With so
much conflicting teaching so readily available on the Internet, those of
us who lead Bible studies must be prepared to teach the trustworthy
Word, and to rebuke those who contradict it.

But, beyond the content of our teaching, what we do and how we teach
others matters greatly. One of the easiest ways to discredit someone’s
teaching is to discredit the person. If you can destroy that person’s
reputation, few will find what he or she says credible. Paul knows those
who oppose the gospel are looking for opportunities to criticize those
who teach it. If the critics can find any excuse to publicly denounce
Titus for things he has done or said, they will use it to their
advantage. Paul urges Titus to be a model of good works, not a hypocrite
– teaching one thing, but living a different way. He also urges
integrity in his teaching, showing consistency over time in what he
teaches and how he lives out that message. Titus’ teaching also needs to
be “serious” in the sense that he emphasizes the weightiness or gravity
of his instruction, not being flippant or blasé. In addition, he must
choose his words carefully so his opponents would not be able to latch
onto something he says and use it to publicly criticize him. Paul knows
from experience the importance of these issues, and he wants to help
Titus avoid such challenges and enjoy a fruitful teaching ministry. We
would do well to heed Paul’s advice today.

As I said at the start, because so many of us regularly use social
media, we must be especially careful how we express and share our
perspectives/opinions with others. Even if we post something to a
specific person, or a closed group, nothing we say is ever really
private. Our response to one person might be shared with others, some of
whom may be quite happy to criticize, condemn, or given the opportunity,
lift us up to public ridicule. We must employ careful reflection before
we write. James points out that those who teach will be judged with
greater strictness, and he speaks of the challenge of taming the tongue
with the ensuing damage it can cause when we don’t control it (James
3:1-12). I don’t know about you, but as I consider Paul’s exhortation, I
recognize that to do this well, I will need God’s help. It is so easy to
make a snide remark, to write in exaggerated ways to make a point, or to
write something that I later regret when I am feeling disappointed in
someone. So, I pray for God to help me tame my tongue, so that what I
say to others won’t become an excuse for some to dismiss me, and
therefore discredit the truths I teach.

While we need to be careful in what we say to others, I am thankful that
we can talk with God in more open, unguarded ways. I don’t need to fear
if I say something to Him with a poor attitude, or selfishly, or
pridefully, that God will dismiss or reject me. Instead, because of His
steadfast love for me, He listens, sends the Holy Spirit to confront me,
rebuke me where needed, and work in me to change my heart attitude.
Unlike the Internet, He keeps no records of my indiscretions or sins. As
the Psalmist wrote:

*For as high as the heavens are above the earth,*

*so great is his steadfast love toward those who fear him;*

*as far as the east is from the west,*

*so far does he remove our transgressions from us.*

> (Psalm 103:11-12, ESV)

I am so thankful for His mercy and grace, His listening ear, and His
patient work to transform me more into the image of Christ.
