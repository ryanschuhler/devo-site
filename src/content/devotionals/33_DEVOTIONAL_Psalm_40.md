**Your Law is Within My Heart**

*In sacrifice and offering you have not delighted,*

*but you have given me an open ear.*

*Burnt offering and sin offering*

*you have not required.*

*Then I said, “Behold, I have come;*

*in the scroll of the book it is written of me:*

*I delight to do your will, O my God;*

*your law is within my heart.”*

*I have told the glad news of deliverance*

*in the great congregation;*

*behold, I have not restrained my lips,*

*as you know, O LORD.*

*I have not hidden your deliverance within my heart;*

*I have spoken of your faithfulness and your salvation;*

*I have not concealed your steadfast love and your faithfulness*

*from the great congregation.*

(Psalm 40:6-10, ESV)

**I** tend to be a “doer.” While I can enjoy a quiet morning, I have a
hard time sitting still for very long, and my mind quickly gravitates to
thinking about the next task I’ll be doing, or event I’ll be
participating in. I like to plan ahead, study what I’ll be teaching in
my next Bible study session, sketch out plans for future ministry
opportunities. To some degree, I believe this can be a gift and a
reflection of how God made me, but I also recognize it is not all that
is important in my walk with God. He desires relationship with me, not
just my service.

I love how this passage begins: *“In sacrifice and offering you have not
delighted, but you have given me an open ear.”* God is not only
interested in what I can do for Him, what I can offer Him, but He
invites me to come and talk with Him. God is the “Great Listener.” He
offers me an open ear, an opportunity to sit with Him and talk with Him
about what is happening in my life and in the world around me. This is a
marvelous gift, and I must slow down enough to receive and enjoy it.

This passage also highlights how God wants to use His Word to impact me
and my ministry with others. God’s law, His Scriptures, are not merely
external guidelines and standards that I must learn and adhere to. They
are a force the Holy Spirit can use to shape my heart and will, to
renovate my heart so that the things God loves and desires increasingly
become my own delight. I am to take God’s law in and meditate on it, so
the Holy Spirit can write it on my heart, shaping my heart’s desires and
motivations. My obedience then becomes a matter of love, not fear – done
willingly, not begrudgingly. This is *real* transformation, something
God desires for all who would lead and teach others.

Finally, this passage reminds me that when it comes to teaching and
leading others in Bible study, God is the hero of the story we share. We
are to celebrate *His* character and *His* actions. The psalmist, so
overwhelmed with the wonder of what God has done for His people, does
not hesitate to share with others about God’s deliverance and salvation,
God’s steadfast love and faithfulness. The psalmist may have been
reflecting on God’s deliverance of Israel during the Exodus, or perhaps
on more recent examples of God’s protection and salvation. While we can
share in this same excitement, this side of the cross we are overwhelmed
by the mercy and grace of God has shown to us in Christ’s death for us
to save us. As Paul wrote to the church in Rome,

> *“For while we were still weak, at the right time Christ died for the
> ungodly. For one will scarcely die for a righteous person—though
> perhaps for a good person one would dare even to die—but God shows his
> love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us”*
> (Romans 5:6-8, ESV).

It is this mercy and grace, this steadfast love, this faithfulness of
God that we recognize and affirm in His Word. As we reflect on this, we
cannot remain silent. Like the psalmist, we are compelled to share God’s
greatness with others, telling the glad news of His deliverance, His
faithfulness to His people, both in the past and today. We affirm His
steadfast love, even when we don’t necessarily feel it or feel unworthy
of it.

How do the psalmist’s words resonate with your own heart? Are you
finding time to recognize God’s “open ear” and talk with Him regularly?
Is God’s Word shaping your loves and desires, forming your heart to be
more like His own? Are you excited to share about God’s deliverance, His
faithfulness, and His steadfast love? If you feel weak in this area
right now, seek God through prayer and His Word, and let Him renew your
heart until you cannot keep silent about His marvelous mercy and grace
in Christ!

> *Father, I am so grateful that You offer me an open ear. Please help
> me to take advantage of this gift every day. Thank You that You desire
> relationship with me and the opportunity to shape my heart more than
> whatever tasks I can do for You. Your love is overwhelming! Please
> help me not to remain silent, but to share Your salvation with those
> who need to hear it. May Your faithfulness and steadfast love be so
> real to me that it becomes the center focus of my teaching. In this
> way, may You be glorified and celebrated! Amen.*
