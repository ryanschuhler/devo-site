**Watching Both Ourselves and Our Teaching**

> *If you put these things before the brothers, you will be a good
> servant of Christ Jesus, being trained in the words of the faith and
> of the good doctrine that you have followed. Have nothing to do with
> irreverent, silly myths. Rather train yourself for godliness; for
> while bodily training is of some value, godliness is of value in every
> way, as it holds promise for the present life and also for the life to
> come. The saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance. For
> to this end we toil and strive, because we have our hope set on the
> living God, who is the Savior of all people, especially of those who
> believe.*
>
> *Command and teach these things. Let no one despise you for your
> youth, but set the believers an example in speech, in conduct, in
> love, in faith, in purity. Until I come, devote yourself to the public
> reading of Scripture, to exhortation, to teaching. Do not neglect the
> gift you have, which was given you by prophecy when the council of
> elders laid their hands on you. Practice these things, immerse
> yourself in them, so that all may see your progress. Keep a close
> watch on yourself and on the teaching. Persist in this, for by so
> doing you will save both yourself and your hearers.* (1 Timothy
> 4:6-16, ESV)

**S**ometimes, as I read portions of the Bible, I try to imagine what it
would have been like to be one of the characters in the story. When I
was younger, I sometimes wondered what it would have been like to be
Timothy, appointed to lead in his church at a young age, watching Paul
leave as his mission journey continued. Most likely, I would have felt
both deeply sad to see Paul go, and intimidated with the new
responsibility I was commissioned for. Paul understood at least some of
what Timothy might have been wrestling with, and his letters addressed
several issues that are as important to us today as they were to
Timothy.

In this passage, Paul affirms the soundness of the teaching Timothy has
received, reminding him that the purpose of this instruction was for
training in godliness. The goal for us, as well, is not to be clever or
smart, up on the latest irreverent and silly myths. Though these may be
interesting and make a person feel superior to others, God’s goal for
our training is for us become more like Christ, and to share more in the
character of God Himself. Inner transformation matters most, including
our *own* transformation as people who lead Bible study groups, and it
comes from giving attention beyond just knowing the Scriptures and good
doctrine. These truths must impact how we walk with God, how we live our
lives in light of the truths we affirm. Paul demonstrated its importance
in how he and others toiled and strove for it, because they had set
their hope on the living God, their Savior. God can accomplish this as
we set our hope on Him and His ability to work within us—such an
important reminder for us all. I know I need it!

Paul goes on to encourage Timothy not to let his young age hinder his
ministry, but to set an example for others both in what he says and
does, in his faith in Christ and love for God and others, and in living
his life in obedience to God. Paul’s directives reflect what he wrote
earlier about godliness being the goal of training, and he urges Timothy
to lead and teach by example, not just words. But words *are* important
and have power to help others grow in their faith. So, Paul urges
Timothy to devote himself to sharing the Scriptures with the gathered
church, to exhort them to respond to God’s instruction, and to teach
them the great truths of the Bible. Paul has confidence in the power of
God to transform people as they attend to His Word, understand it, and
respond to it. This is why our own group Bible studies are so important.
God meets us as we gather together to hear, read, and study His Word, so
that we might respond in faith and obedience. He is always ready to work
in us as we seek His help to live out what we learn. Like Timothy, we
need to devote ourselves to the ministry of the Word, trusting that as
we do so, God is at work.

Finally, Paul clearly reiterates how important Timothy’s life example is
for his ability to shepherd others. Paul urges him to “Keep a good watch
on yourself and on the teaching.” Both Timothy’s life example as someone
God is growing, as well as the truthfulness of his teaching, are
important. The example of his life is testimony to the power and impact
of the gospel, and the truthfulness of his teaching is foundational to a
faithful response to God. Both are critical. God calls us today to
exercise similar care, in the life example we live out before those we
teach, and the accuracy of our teaching itself. Both aspects matter to
God, and both impact those we teach. May God help us to attend well to
both!

> *Father, I am grateful for your ability to use me in ministry with
> others, whatever my age. Thank you for the power of your Word to
> transform lives as your Spirit works within me. May my own life as a
> Bible study leader increasingly show your gracious renovating work in
> me, helping me live out what I share with others and exhort them to
> pursue. Help me pay attention both to my talk and to my walk, so that
> I honor you in what I say and do. Amen.*
