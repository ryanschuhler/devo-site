**Teaching with Patience and Gentleness**

> *So flee youthful passions and pursue righteousness, faith, love, and
> peace, along with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart. Have
> nothing to do with foolish, ignorant controversies; you know that they
> breed quarrels. And the Lord’s servant must not be quarrelsome but
> kind to everyone, able to teach, patiently enduring evil, correcting
> his opponents with gentleness. God may perhaps grant them repentance
> leading to a knowledge of the truth, and they may come to their senses
> and escape from the snare of the devil, after being captured by him to
> do his will.* (2 Timothy 2:22-26, ESV)

**H**ave you ever been in a situation where you were teaching or leading
a Bible study and someone began to argue with you on a particular issue,
offering a different interpretation of what the Bible taught? How did
you respond? This can feel very awkward and messy because different
things impact my reaction. On the one hand, if I’ve taken a stand on
something in a group and someone contradicts me, I may naturally react
defensively. I don’t like being contradicted in public. On the other
hand, how the person who disagrees with me acts can make a difference.
If they disagree, yet offer clear, convincing reasons in a gentle and
friendly way, then I’m more open to changing my mind, and I may even be
grateful they challenged me to rethink the issue. But, if they are
argumentative, or offer reasons I find less than convincing, I may argue
back, and the discussion can deteriorate to where we’re no longer really
listening to each other.

Paul knew that Timothy would face some false teachers in Ephesus, and he
wanted to offer guidance on how to respond. He begins this passage,
warning Timothy not to become involved in “ignorant controversies” that
lead to quarreling and division in the church. It is best to avoid some
topics, because they are foolish arguments that do nothing to build up
the body of Christ. Timothy must learn to discern important issues to
address as well as what should be ignored. For unproductive
controversies, the best thing is to avoid entering into the debate at
all.

When, in a discussion, disagreement occurs over an important issue, Paul
urges Timothy to respond in kindness, taking time to teach and explain
what the Scriptures say, and in patience if others mistreat him in the
process. Gentle correction will more likely encourage the other person
to reconsider what was said, to be sensitive to where God may want them
to change their thinking, and to repent and embrace the truth, so they
no longer be misled by the Devil. The people who disagree or argue are
not the enemy—Satan is—and Paul encourages Timothy to have empathy for
them, and to care about more than just winning the argument.

Paul’s words are good guidance for me, as well. Sometimes I am tempted,
if challenged as I teach, to win the argument at all costs, validating
my intelligence and mastery of what the Bible teaches on an issue. On
the contrary, God calls on me to care for my brother or sister and seek
to win them over, assuming they really are misunderstanding something
important. Teaching should be an act of love and care for the other
person, not a contest of wills or wits. I must develop thick skin as I
teach, forgiving others if they disagree with me in unkind ways. I must
also be willing to listen and learn from them if they bring up an
important point I need to consider. Gentleness and patience of this kind
allows us to continue the conversation long enough to gain clarity, and
God can use that dialog to correct wrong understandings, and even to
bring about repentance where needed.

I knew a man who participated in various apologetics debates. When I
listened to him talk about recent events he had participated in, he
would sometimes gloat about having “drawn first blood.” I understand
debating is a different venue with additional goals to consider. But as
I read Paul’s words to Timothy, I am convinced that not only *what we
say* matters in a debate – as if winning people over was simply an
intellectual exercise – but also *how* *we say it*, and *how we treat*
those with whom we disagree. If our behavior is arrogant, unkind,
insulting, or bullying, we may win “points” but we will lose the true
goal of the debate – convincing people to change their minds and embrace
an important truth. Our demeanor may cause others to dismiss our
altogether. As we teach, our character matters, not just the message we
share.

Paul’s wise words to Timothy instruct us, as well. In teaching, our
focus is to win persons, not points, and at times this will involve
grace, gentleness, forgiveness, and patience, as we trust God to change
minds and bring about repentance. It is God at work in the minds and
hearts of those we teach. This gives all the more reason that we pray
for those we teach, and for ourselves, that we would help, not become an
obstacle to their learning. I pray this goal will characterize your
teaching in your Bible study group.

> *Father, thank you first of all for patiently teaching me through your
> Word. I am grateful for the wonderful blessing of Your steadfast love
> for me, in spite of my disobedience and stubbornness. As I teach,
> would you help me to have the same patient love that you have for me?
> May my teaching be characterized by gentleness and patience, allowing
> you to do the convincing and convicting work that leads to repentance.
> I am so thankful to be able to partner with you in my teaching
> efforts, knowing that you bring about the lasting change needed--to
> you be the glory! Amen.*
