# DEVOTIONAL 4

**Learning and Growing Day by Day**

> *So those who received his word were baptized, and there were added
> that day about three thousand souls. And they devoted themselves to
> the apostles’ teaching and the fellowship, to the breaking of bread
> and the prayers. And awe came upon every soul, and many wonders and
> signs were being done through the apostles. And all who believed were
> together and had all things in common. And they were selling their
> possessions and belongings and distributing the proceeds to all, as
> any had need. And day by day, attending the temple together and
> breaking bread in their homes, they received their food with glad and
> generous hearts, praising God and having favor with all the people.
> And the Lord added to their number day by day those who were being
> saved.* (Acts 2:41-47, ESV)

**T**his passage comes at the end of the amazing story of Pentecost,
when the Holy Spirit came upon the gathered apostles like a mighty wind
and enabled them to speak in other languages. As they spoke, Jewish
people from various nations who had gathered in Jerusalem during
Shavuot, or the Feast of Weeks, were able to hear and understand in
their own language about the mighty works of God accomplished in Jesus’
death and resurrection. This festival, held 50 days after Passover, was
one of three pilgrimage festivals, where Jewish males would come to
Jerusalem, bringing offerings. It brought Jews from many nations to
Israel. It was a joyful feast celebrating the harvest, and God chose
this gathering to be the launching point for the apostles’ ministry. The
reaction of the crowd to the apostles was mixed, with most being amazed
and perplexed by what they heard, but others mocked the apostles,
attributing their strange behavior to too much wine.

At this point, Peter, the apostle Jesus commissioned to “feed my sheep”
(John 21:15-17), preached a powerful sermon, declaring that Jesus of
Nazareth, whom they had crucified, had been raised from the dead. He was
the Christ, the prophesied Savior and Lord, and what they were seeing
and hearing that day was the fulfillment of the promise of the Holy
Spirit whom God had sent.

As this passage begins, we see that many of the people responded in
faith, and about three thousand were baptized that day. This was an
amazing response to Peter’s evangelistic message, and I find what he and
the other apostles did next so instructive for my own teaching ministry.
More sheep had joined the flock, but they needed to be fed so they could
grow in their new faith.

The passage tells us that these new believers devoted themselves to the
apostles’ teaching, to the fellowship of this new community, to sharing
meals with each other and praying together. They shared their resources
to care for each other’s needs, worshiped at the temple, and gathered in
homes for common meals, praising God. In all of this, they had favor
with the people in Jerusalem, and more and more people came to faith in
Christ through their witness and example. What a powerful and amazing
experience!

Sometimes in the church we feel a bit of tension between our efforts to
share the gospel message with others and to teach or “disciple” those
who have already responded in faith. How much priority should we give to
each aspect? Here, in Acts 2, we see a good example of how the apostles
handled this. They began with a strong evangelistic emphasis as they
shared the gospel with the people on the Day of Pentecost, and followed
up that initial message with daily teaching in the Temple courts. All of
the new believers devoted themselves to this teaching, fellowship, and
prayer, and in turn, influenced others to put their faith in Christ.

I find it helpful to think about evangelism as “obstetrics,” delivering
a new baby that has come to full term. The doctor does not create the
baby, God does, but the doctor aids in its delivery when the time is
right and ensures it begins life safely. But new babies have many needs,
and I like to think of discipleship as “pediatrics,” providing care and
proper diet to help the new baby grow healthily. The apostles understood
that both aspects of their ministry were important, and they continued
to proclaim the gospel message and to teach these new disciples all that
Jesus had commanded, just as He told them to (Matthew 28:16-20).

I want my own ministry to have these same priorities, and to take the
same care with new believers that the apostles showed. Too often
evangelistic gatherings take place where people come to faith in Christ,
but they receive limited follow up to support, ground, and feed them as
new believers. On the other hand, too often we continue to feed the
sheep we have without looking beyond our own flock to whoever else needs
to hear the gospel message and be invited into God’s flock. I find I
lean heavily toward the pediatrics side, and I need to give more
priority to obstetrics. I enjoy the opportunity to teach, the fellowship
together, praying with my brothers and sisters in Christ, but I need a
greater vision for how to take the gospel message to others who need to
hear it.

How about you and your church? As you read about the apostles and the
way they launched their ministry of making disciples, what aspects are
reflected well in your church’s ministry, and in your own teaching
ministry? Where might God want you to stretch outside your usual
emphasis? May God give you a growing desire and understanding of how to
see both aspects – obstetrics and pediatrics – reflected well in your
ministry.
