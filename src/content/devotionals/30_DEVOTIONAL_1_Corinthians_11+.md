**Growing Through Imitation**

> *Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved children. And walk in love,
> as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us, a fragrant offering and
> sacrifice to God.* (Ephesians 5:1-2, ESV)
>
> *Be imitators of me, as I am of Christ.* (1 Corinthians 11:1, ESV)
>
> *I do not write these things to make you ashamed, but to admonish you
> as my beloved children. For though you have countless guides in
> Christ, you do not have many fathers. For I became your father in
> Christ Jesus through the gospel. I urge you, then, be imitators of me.
> That is why I sent you Timothy, my beloved and faithful child in the
> Lord, to remind you of my ways in Christ, as I teach them everywhere
> in every church.* (1 Corinthians 4:14-17, ESV)
>
> *Brothers, join in imitating me, and keep your eyes on those who walk
> according to the example you have in us.* (Philippians 3:17, ESV)

**T**here is an old adage about learning that says “more is caught than
taught.” When it comes to leading Bible studies, this reminds us that
those we teach learn not only from what we say, they observe our
behavior, and that, too, shapes what they learn. We call this phenomenon
“social learning.” Social learning is so powerful, that when what we say
differs from what we do, those we are teaching tend to follow what we do
more than what we say. For example, if I tell others they should be
patient with one another, but they see me express my impatience with
someone, they will tend to feel more freedom to be impatient with others
as well. On the other hand, if I am consistent in what I say and what my
group members see me do, it tends to reinforce their learning and shape
their behavior in a positive way. They see what I am teaching in action,
helping them to have a good model to imitate.

I am fortunate to have had many teachers over the years who were
excellent examples of what they taught me, and I know that their living
examples were instrumental in helping me begin to apply what I was
learning to my own life. They were positive models to follow and gave me
hope that what I was being challenged to do was actually possible. Our
growth in faith is not just a matter of what we know and believe, but
also how we live in light of those truths. We need not only admonitions
to be faithful to God, but good examples to follow.

Paul recognized the power of imitation as a means for learning and
growth. He approached this truth in many different ways, each time
highlighting the importance of a faithful response to what they were
learning.

*Be imitators of God, as beloved children* (Ephesians 5:1). We are God’s
children, and we are to grow up to be like him, just as children imitate
their parents. God is our ultimate example. As Oscar Wilde said,
“Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery that mediocrity can pay to
greatness.” No one is greater than God, and we are called to imitate
Him, to become more like Him, not just to learn about Him. He is our
“gold standard” for a faithful life.

*Be imitators of me as I am of Christ* (1 Corinthians 11:1)*.* Jesus
Christ is the primary example of what God is like. In Christ, we come to
know God’s character, and Paul encourages others to imitate him as he
seeks to imitate Christ in his own life. This is not arrogance, but
humility, pointing beyond himself to the one he seeks to imitate.

*I became your father in Christ Jesus through the gospel . . . be
imitators of me* (1 Corinthians 4:15b-16)*.* Paul recognized that he had
a special relationship with the church in Corinth and that they looked
to him for guidance on how to live out their faith. He reminds them of
this relationship and encourages them to follow his example. He sends
Timothy to remind them of his ways, not just his words.

*Join in imitating me, and keep your eyes on those who walk according to
the example you have in us* (Philippians 3:17). Paul recognized he was
not the only example to follow, but that within the church there were
others who were living faithfully, and the church members should learn
from those whose lives exemplify the teaching they have received.

*Remember your leaders, . . . imitate their faith* (Hebrews 13:7). The
writer of Hebrews also recognized the power of example, and encouraged
the church to look to the lives of their leaders and imitate the faith
they lived out.

Does any of this make you anxious or nervous as a Bible study leader? It
should. None of us are perfect examples of what we are teaching from
Scripture. I am frequently aware of my own need for growth and greater
faithfulness as I teach others. I believe that God can use this
recognition of inadequacy in two important ways. First, knowing that the
example of my own life has some impact on those I teach, I turn to God,
asking Him to work in my own life so that I can be a better example of
someone He is transforming, even when there is still a long way to go.
Second, I can share how God is at work within me, and point to God as
the one to imitate. Like Paul, I can say, “Be imitators of me as I am of
Christ,” and I can point to the grace of God at work within me, even as
I struggle to consistently live out what He is teaching me. I’m a fellow
learner, and God is our teacher. He is our Father, and we learn to
imitate Him as His children. As we seek to imitate Him, He will work
through His Spirit to transform us. This truth gives me great hope in my
teaching!
