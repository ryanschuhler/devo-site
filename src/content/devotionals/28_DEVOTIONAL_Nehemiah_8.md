**The Joy of the Lord is Your Strength**

> *And all the people gathered as one man into the square before the
> Water Gate. And they told Ezra the scribe to bring the Book of the Law
> of Moses that the LORD had commanded Israel. So Ezra the priest
> brought the Law before the assembly, both men and women and all who
> could understand what they heard, on the first day of the seventh
> month. And he read from it facing the square before the Water Gate
> from early morning until midday, in the presence of the men and the
> women and those who could understand. And the ears of all the people
> were attentive to the Book of the Law. . . . And Ezra opened the book
> in the sight of all the people, for he was above all the people, and
> as he opened it all the people stood. And Ezra blessed the LORD, the
> great God, and all the people answered, “Amen, Amen,” lifting up their
> hands. And they bowed their heads and worshiped the LORD with their
> faces to the ground. Also Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub,
> Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan,
> Pelaiah, the Levites, helped the people to understand the Law, while
> the people remained in their places. They read from the book, from the
> Law of God, clearly, and they gave the sense, so that the people
> understood the reading.*
>
> *And Nehemiah, who was the governor, and Ezra the priest and scribe,
> and the Levites who taught the people said to all the people, “This
> day is holy to the LORD your God; do not mourn or weep.” For all the
> people wept as they heard the words of the Law. Then he said to them,
> “Go your way. Eat the fat and drink sweet wine and send portions to
> anyone who has nothing ready, for this day is holy to our Lord. And do
> not be grieved, for the joy of the LORD is your strength.” So the
> Levites calmed all the people, saying, “Be quiet, for this day is
> holy; do not be grieved.” And all the people went their way to eat and
> drink and to send portions and to make great rejoicing, because they
> had understood the words that were declared to them.*

**H**ave you ever read a portion of Scripture, and it moved your heart
so much that tears formed in your eyes? Or, have you ever been in a
worship service and the words of a song caused your eyes to “leak”? I
have. Sometimes, as we reflect on the message of the Scriptures, that is
the most fitting response we could have. They may be tears of sorrow or
of joy. In either case, engaging our hearts is an important part of the
process of learning and growing.

Here, in the book of Nehemiah, the people of Israel have finally
completed the work of rebuilding the city walls. It has been a long,
hard process, with many challenges and threats from their neighboring
communities. But the hard work is now done and they have much to
celebrate. But instead of throwing a party, Nehemiah and Ezra know that
more needs to happen. It is not enough to have rebuilt walls, or a
rebuilt temple. God’s greater concern is with His people’s hearts. There
is work to be done to rebuild their covenant relationship together. This
begins with the reading of God’s Word.

I love reading and seeing in this passage how the people gathered for
the reading of the Book of the Law. This was the first time in
generations it had happened, and everyone wanted to be there. Not only
were the adults there (men and women), but older children as well *(“all
who could understand what they heard”)*. As Ezra read to the people,
several Levites took turns explaining it so that everyone could
understand its meaning. This wasn’t just a ceremonial reading, but a
time of instruction to ensure God’s Word be clearly understood. And, as
we see the impact the reading had on the assembly, it clearly was! “For
all the people wept as they heard the words of the Law.”

Sometimes the Scriptures we teach stir our hearts, and we grieve because
we recognize our failures and our sin. This is what happened as Ezra and
the Levites read and explained the Scriptures to the people. Their tears
were a fitting response, given how far the people had wandered from
following God’s law. However, Nehemiah, Ezra, and the Levites didn’t
just rub it in, leaving them with their sense of guilt. Rather, they
offered hope and encouragement to the people. That day, they sent them
home to feast, assuring them that “the joy of the Lord is your
strength.” The next day, they began to celebrate the Feast of Booths,
commemorating God’s provision for His people in the years of desert
wandering before they came into the Promised Land, and they continued to
read from the Book of the Law (Nehemiah 8:13-18). All of this led up to
a day of repentance and reaffirming of their covenant relationship with
God (Nehemiah 9). What began with broken-hearted grief ends in
repentance and renewal of their walk with God!

God’s Word is not just meant to stir our thinking; as we reflect on it,
it should also stir our hearts. Paul had a similar experience when the
Corinthians read one of his letters and grieved. In 2 Corinthians, he
wrote: “. . . I rejoice, not because you were grieved, but because you
were grieved into repenting” (7:9a). As you teach, be prepared both to
explain God’s law, which points out our sin, and the hope we have in the
gospel of Jesus Christ. Sorrow and grief can be a good thing, if it
leads us to repent and renew our walk with God. As unpleasant as
struggles can be, sometimes they are exactly what we need!

> *Father, thank you for your steadfast love, your patience as you
> appeal to me through your Word to recognize where I have strayed from
> what you desire. Help me to so teach and lead others to better
> understand your Word that your Holy Spirit is able to convict my heart
> where that is needed. Help me to grieve well and turn to you for
> forgiveness and renewal. Thank you that your joy is my strength, and
> my grieving can give way to joy as I receive your grace in and through
> Christ Jesus. I praise you for this reassurance of your steadfast love
> for me! Amen.*
