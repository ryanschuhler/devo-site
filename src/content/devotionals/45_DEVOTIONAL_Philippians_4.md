# DEVOTIONAL 45

**Focusing on the Good, Practicing What We Learn**

> *Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever
> is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is
> commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy
> of praise, think about these things. What you have learned and
> received and heard and seen in me—practice these things, and the God
> of peace will be with you.* (Philippians 4:8-9, ESV)

**W**ho was one of your best Bible study leaders? What made him or her
so impactful? When I ask myself those same questions, it is interesting
who comes to mind. One person was a math professor at my college who
hosted a Bible study group at his home on Sunday nights. He had a
stutter (except when he prayed or sang) and was not a Bible scholar, but
he led us, by example, to take the Scripture passages we studied
seriously, commit ourselves to live them out, and to honestly address
our challenges, failures, and successes. We did not hurry through the
text, but lingered over those areas where God desired some faithful
response from us. All these good things had an impact, but when I think
carefully about these experiences, I also recognize his openness about
his own walk with God, and the way he modeled a commitment to change and
to follow God closely, gave me an example to follow, and real hope that
God could do the same work in me.

Another person who comes to mind is a New Testament professor I had in
college. He was a good Bible scholar and he knew the material we were
studying very well. In some cases, learning from a scholar of his
caliber could be intimidating, but that was not the case with him. He
modeled for us a great love for God, a dependence on God, and a desire
to follow Him closely in his own walk. He started every class with
prayer, and I found these prayers deeply moving, a model to my own
prayer life, and an encouragement to my heart to love and follow God in
all my life. I always looked forward to class, just so I could hear him
pray. He was an excellent teacher, and demonstrated that same spirit of
love and dependence on God as we studied to understand the text and
learn from God.

In the latter part of Paul’s letter to the church in Philippi, he
addressed a number of issues in the church. As he wrapped up, he
encouraged them to focus their thoughts on good things, things worthy of
praise, knowing that people often get discouraged as they focus on their
challenges and the hard things happening around them. But he did not
encourage them with a simple “think happy thoughts.” He also urged them
to remember what they had learned from him, and that learning was not
just a matter of knowledge, but also of example, like the two people I
described above. Paul called them to remember what they had learned
*from* *him*, what they had seen *in him*, and to put these things into
practice. Paul knew that a teacher’s power comes not just from his or
her words, but also in how they live—that both words of teaching and the
living example are sources of learning and behavioral changes. We must
remember this in our own teaching efforts. Both what we say and what we
do impact those we lead and teach, and our actions influence and
encourage greater openness to learn from what we say.

As you think about your own Bible teaching ministry, are you comfortable
encouraging your students to learn, both from what you say and what they
see in your life? None of us are perfect examples of what we teach, but
can you encourage them to strive after the things you are striving
after? Do you share areas God is helping you grow? Paul understood that
how he lived was part of the “curriculum” of his teaching, not just the
content he taught. This should humble us and lead us to pray for God’s
help to be a positive example of what we teach. For this reason, our own
transformation by the work of the Holy Spirit is so important, and is
why we need to learn and put into practice what we read in the
Scriptures as a foundation for teaching them to others.

Take time to remember those Bible teachers and Bible study leaders God
used to impact your life. Pray that God will help grow you to have some
of those same qualities as you teach and lead others, and “the God of
peace will be with you.” What a wonderful promise!
