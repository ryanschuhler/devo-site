**Do You Love Me? Feed My Lambs**

> *When they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, “Simon,
> son of John, do you love me more than these?” He said to him, “Yes,
> Lord; you know that I love you.” He said to him, “Feed my lambs.” He
> said to him a second time, “Simon, son of John, do you love me?” He
> said to him, “Yes, Lord; you know that I love you.” He said to him,
> “Tend my sheep.” He said to him the third time, “Simon, son of John,
> do you love me?” Peter was grieved because he said to him the third
> time, “Do you love me?” and he said to him, “Lord, you know
> everything; you know that I love you.” Jesus said to him, “Feed my
> sheep.*
>
> (John 21:15-17, ESV)

**I** cannot imagine how devastated Peter must have felt when he found
himself, out of fear for his own safety, denying that he ever knew Jesus
(John 18). It happened right after Jesus was arrested and taken to the
high priests for questioning. It also happened just as Jesus said it
would, and Peter, “the Rock,” despite his protests that this could never
happen, found himself crumbling into sand under pressure. And it
happened not just once, but three times, each time hammering his soul as
he denied being one of Jesus’ disciples. I cannot imagine the pain,
confusion, fear, guilt, and shame that Peter experienced. It’s too much
to bear!

I cannot imagine how overwhelmed Peter must have felt when three days
later he raced John to Jesus’ tomb and found it empty, and then later
that day when the resurrected Jesus appeared to the disciples behind
locked doors and said “Peace be with you” (John 20). It happened just as
Jesus said it would, and Peter, who thought that his life was over,
found that it was only just beginning, and that Jesus was sending him
and the other disciples out as apostles (“sent ones”) to proclaim the
gospel of the forgiveness of sin. I cannot imagine the wonder,
confusion, joy, and amazement that Peter experienced. It’s too much to
take in, too good to be true!

And now, some days later, Jesus appears to several of the disciples as
they are fishing on the Sea of Tiberias and provides them with an
amazing catch of fish. Peter, in his eager haste to be with Jesus, jumps
into the water and swims to shore. There they find Jesus offering them a
warm breakfast, and as the meal is over, Jesus turns to Peter with a
troubling and penetrating question: “Simon, son of John, do you love me
more than these?”

I cannot imagine how Peter felt as Jesus began to question his love for
Him. I suspect some of the old shame and guilt returned, especially as
Jesus asked him this same question three times, echoing the three
denials in the high priests’ courtyard after Jesus was arrested. But
Jesus did not just rub salt in the open wound and leave Peter wallowing
in his sense of shame. Instead, He gave him a simple charge to keep, out
of his love for Jesus: “Feed my lambs. . .. Tend my sheep. . .. Feed my
sheep."

I find this passage deeply encouraging as I reflect on God’s grace and
forgiveness in my own life, and how in spite of my failures and sin,
Jesus still calls me, like Peter, to feed His sheep. Jesus, because of
His mercy and grace, forgives my sin, and calls me to proclaim this
gospel of forgiveness to others as an act of love. I don’t have to be
perfect or “good enough” to teach others about the grace of God; in
fact, it is because I have needed and received God’s forgiveness that I
have something wonderful to share with others. Jesus gave Peter a
commission, a calling to fulfill, motivated by a love for Jesus, and
that same calling is available for you and me today.

Do you love Jesus? One way you can demonstrate your love for Him is to
teach others about Him, about His life, ministry, teaching, sacrificial
death and resurrection to bring forgiveness and new life to all who
believe.

Is your teaching an act of love for Jesus, or have you lost that sense
of love in the midst of the challenges of teaching? Take time to revisit
the gospel story and wonder at the amazing love and grace of God has
shown to you in Jesus Christ, a grace that could “save a wretch like
me,” as the former slave trader turned pastor, John Newton, wrote. He,
too, knew what it meant to be forgiven and called to “feed my sheep.”
This can be your calling too.

As you prepare your next Bible study session, take time to reflect again
on the “Amazing Grace” of God shown to you in and through Jesus Christ.
Let this stir your heart to a deeper love for God, a love that desires
to tell others, to help them also know God’s grace and to learn how to
live within that grace!

> *Father, thank you for how Jesus forgave Peter his denial of Him and

> have failed you and am not worthy to serve you, and I am so deeply
> thankful for your grace, forgiveness, and calling to feed your flock.
> May I do so out of a strong love for you and a love for your flock.
> Where my love for you has faded, remind me of your great love for me
> and stir my heart to a deeper love that impacts all I do in my walk
> with you, including my teaching. As I do this, may others see more
> clearly your love for them and respond in faith to the grace that I,
> like Peter, have experienced from you. Amen.*
