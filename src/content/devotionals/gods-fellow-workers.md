I have grown up enjoying watching both college and professional
football games on television (American football, not soccer). Friends
often ask me who my team is, and I have to confess that though I am fond
of following a few teams, I am not loyal to any one team in particular.
I like to see a good game, and I like to see teams doing their best. In
contrast, I have a friend at my church who’s been a Miami Dolphins fan
his whole life, and that is *the* team he follows and roots for. He
would never dream of cheering on any other team against his team. I
admire his loyalty. While I think it definitely can be fun to have a
favorite team and cheer them on throughout the season, I’ve just never
made that deep of a commitment or attachment to any one team. I enjoy
being able to cheer for different teams on different occasions. “Team”
loyalty in sports can be fun, but it can create problems in church
ministry.

In this portion of Paul’s letter to the church in Corinth, he rebukes
his brothers and sisters in Christ for their spiritual immaturity,
demonstrated by jealousy and strife over which teacher they say they
follow. It seems that many of them had favorite teachers, (“name
dropping”—I follow so and so…), and cheering on who they thought should
“win” in the competition of “best teacher.” In their view, loyalty to a
teacher was natural, but it ultimately created conflict and disunity in
the church, as each person championed their favorite teacher, causing
them to be critical of others’ teachers. Paul strongly challenges this
partisan thinking, pointing out that the heralded teachers (Apollos,
Paul) are simply members of the *same team*, *fellow workers with God*,
and it is *God* who is the one who brings about growth, not those who
teach. Ultimately, God is our teacher and we should be grateful for all
who have taught us in ways that have opened us up to God’s continuing,
transforming work.

At my seminary, our alumni magazine, *Sundoulos,* reminds me of the many
people who as “fellow servants,” are serving God through the different
ministries He has given them. It helps me remember that I am but a small
part of God’s much larger ministry effort, and though our roles may
vary, we all serve on the same team. Rather than comparing myself and my
ministry to others, I simply need to cheer them on, celebrating how God
is using them to strengthen and build up the church. There is no place
for partisan loyalties that could cause us to unfairly criticize other
ministry leaders or to forget that it is God who gives the growth in all
of our varied ministries. I may plant a seed, or I may water a seed
someone else planted, but it is God who gives the growth.

At times someone will say to me, “I really enjoyed today’s study,” or “I
really liked your sermon today.” It always feels good to receive
positive feedback on my teaching, and I am grateful for those words of
encouragement. Occasionally, someone may compare my teaching or
preaching to someone else’s, saying that they like something I do better
than the other person. When this happens, I have to avoid the temptation
to pride, and instead do my best to affirm the teaching or preaching of
the person I’m being compared to, shifting attention to how wonderful
God’s Word is and how *He* is the one who ultimately teaches us and
helps us grow. I pray that God will help me do this well, and avoid
contributing to any “party loyalties” that might grow within my ministry
setting!

As I said at the start, I don’t have strong team loyalties in football,
but I do love to see a good game where everyone does their best. I need
God’s help to bring that same spirit into the church, and I need to
celebrate the excellent teaching of others, rejoicing in how God uses
them to help others grow in maturity. May God help me be a good
“teammate.”
