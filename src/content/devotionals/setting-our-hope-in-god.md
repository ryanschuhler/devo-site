title: "Setting Our Hope in God"
week: 51

*A Maskil of Asaph.*

*Give ear, O my people, to my teaching;*

*incline your ears to the words of my mouth!*

*I will open my mouth in a parable;*

*I will utter dark sayings from of old,*

*things that we have heard and known,*

*that our fathers have told us.*

*We will not hide them from their children,*

*but tell to the coming generation*

*the glorious deeds of the LORD, and his might,*

*and the wonders that he has done.*

*He established a testimony in Jacob*

*and appointed a law in Israel,*

*which he commanded our fathers*

*to teach to their children,*

*that the next generation might know them,*

*the children yet unborn,*

*and arise and tell them to their children,*

*so that they should set their hope in God*

*and not forget the works of God,*

*but keep his commandments;*

*and that they should not be like their fathers,*

*a stubborn and rebellious generation,*

*a generation whose heart was not steadfast,*

*whose spirit was not faithful to God.*

> (Psalm 78:1-8, ESV)

When it comes to ministry priorities in the church, I’m afraid that
many times we have ours upside-down. This shows up in at least two
fairly common ways. First, while we often gravitate to teaching adults
like ourselves, the psalmist lifts up the priority of teaching our
children, the next generation. Our children depend upon us to tell them
of God’s saving work in history and how to respond to it in faith. The
psalmist declares its importance, and the community’s commitment to do
this well. Second, while many parents take their children to church and
expect others to teach the gospel story to their children, the
Scriptures make it clear that parents play a key role in this effort, as
well. Though others *can* and *do* play an important role in instruction
within the Body of Christ, parents must not abdicate this responsibility
to others. Both home and church play a critical role in children’s faith
formation.

As parents and grandparents, aunts and uncles, we have a primary
responsibility to share the “glorious deeds of the LORD, and his might,
and the wonders he has done” with our children, grandchildren, nieces
and nephews. This directive means more than simply sharing Bible stories
with them. It also includes the ways that God has done great things in
our own lives, how He has answered prayer, the ways He has provided for
His people in the present. We don’t want our children thinking that
God’s works are confined to the past, that He used to do cool things but
that day is now gone. If you have children or grandchildren, nieces or
nephews, share how God has been at work in your own life, share your
favorite Bible stories with them, and let them know why these stories
are so important to you. If you lead Bible studies with adults,
encourage them to do the same with their children, that they, too, might
set their hope on God.

Within the church, I believe we need to rethink the priorities of our
teaching ministries. Bible study opportunities for adults are important,
but they are critical for our children and youth. Adults are more able
to pursue their own study of the Scriptures, and many have been walking
in the Christian faith for years. Further growth is always a value, but
many of these people are ready and able to share what they know with the
younger generation who have not yet had these opportunities. We are in a
time that seems to carry great concern over whether youth who have grown
up participating in the life of the church will continue to embrace
their faith once they leave home. There are many reasons why this
concern is legitimate, and there are many things that can and should be
done to help youth grow deeper in an owned faith commitment. It begins
with ensuring that they know the character of God as shown in the
Scripture, the works He has done for His people, how good His law is,
and how great His grace through Jesus Christ is for us as we fail to
keep that law as well as we should.

We don’t mean to hide this gospel story from our children, but sometimes
our neglect, both at home and at church, keeps it hidden or unclear. As
a Bible study leader, continue to emphasize how important it is that we,
as parents, grandparents, aunts, and uncles, and church leaders
prioritize the teaching of the wonderful gospel story—both past and
present—that the generations to come would put their hope in God. Future
generations are counting on us!

> Help me to be more faithful in this, knowing your own great love for
