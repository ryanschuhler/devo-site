**Examining the Scriptures**

> *The brothers immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Berea,
> and when they arrived they went into the Jewish synagogue. Now these
> Jews were more noble than those in Thessalonica; they received the
> word with all eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see if
> these things were so. Many of them therefore believed, with not a few
> Greek women of high standing as well as men.* (Acts 17:10-12, ESV)

**O**ne of the subtle temptations those of us who lead Bible study
groups may have is the desire to be well-respected and known for our
Bible knowledge. It feels good when people express appreciation for our
teaching, when they look to us to sort out difficult passages, when they
put their trust in our interpretation of a text. We are tempted to pride
as we teach, and our egos are stroked as others rely on us for their
understanding of the Bible. All who teach or preach the Word must watch
out for this temptation and guard against it!

One way we can fight this temptation as Bible study leaders is not to
just teach or share the conclusions of our own study of the Bible, but
also to explain how we studied and arrived at our conclusions, and to
teach others how to do the same kind of study. When we do this well, we
point people’s praise and appreciation more to God and how wonderful His
Word is rather than how wonderful we are as teachers. In addition,
rather than encouraging people to be dependent on us for understanding
the Scriptures, we can help teach them the skills to study it
themselves. Instead of us just feeding them, we help them learn how to
feed themselves. Over time, we can develop a fellowship where all are
able to study and to help each other learn God’s Word. In doing so, we
also encourage greater dependence on God, rather than on ourselves.

In Macedonia, during this second missionary journey, Paul and Silas were
experiencing a challenging time in their ministry of proclaiming the
gospel of Jesus Christ. They had been arrested and imprisoned in
Philippi and miraculously freed by God. In Thessalonica, a mob dragged
them before the city authorities and accused them of stirring up a
rebellion against Caesar. It seemed wise to get Paul and Silas out of
town before something more serious happened, so they went by night to
nearby Berea where they again went to the Jewish synagogue to proclaim
the gospel message of the life, death, and resurrection of the promised
Savior, Jesus Christ.

What I find interesting about their experience in Berea is as the people
heard Paul and Silas’s message, they did not just accept it or reject it
without checking it out. Luke, the author of Acts, commends the people
of Berea as being “more noble than those in Thessalonica; they received
the word with all eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see if
these things were so.” They took the time to compare what they heard
with what the Scriptures said. As they did their own study of the
Scriptures, many became convinced and believed, both Jews and Greeks.

Let me ask you this: If a guest teacher or speaker came to your church
and preached a message that was a bit controversial, would many of those
who heard the message have the knowledge and skills to know how to study
the relevant Scriptures to see if what the speaker said was right? Or,
would they simply turn to the leaders of your church and ask them if
what was said was correct? Another way of thinking about it is, are your
people dependent on you or other leaders to know what to believe, or can
they study the Bible itself in pursuit of understanding? Are they
equipped to distinguish false from true teaching, or might they be easy
victims to a powerful speaker or cult leader? Paul’s teaching was new to
most of the people, so it was right not to simply accept it without
checking it out. But their own careful study of the Scriptures backed up
his message, and many responded in faith.

One of the major issues addressed in the Protestant Reformation was to
encourage dependence on the Scriptures and not on some other authority.
“Sola Scriptura,” the Scriptures alone, were to be the guide for faith.
Martin Luther, and many others, wanted to make the Scriptures available
in the common language of their people so that they could read and study
it together, not just remain dependent on a priest or bishop’s
interpretation. This was one reason behind Luther’s support that
schooling be made available to all boys and girls, and that they learn
Hebrew and Greek so they could study God’s Word themselves.

We live in a time when the Scriptures are readily available to most
people in the West. Are we encouraging and equipping people to study
them, or are we content to allow them to remain dependent on us for
their understanding? If we are to multiply the ministry of the Word in
our congregations and Christian fellowships, we need to invest time in
teaching how to study the Scriptures. This investment can help reduce
our own temptation to pride, and equip our people to distinguish truth
from falsehood as they listen to podcasts or attend worship services in
different churches. It’s worth the investment!
