**Endurance, Encouragement, and Hope**

“**W**hy should we bother reading or studying the Bible? After all, it’s
about events that happened long ago, in a different land and culture.
How can that help us now? How is it relevant to my life now?” We live in
a time when many people are skeptical that the Bible has anything useful
to say for life today. In their minds, the Bible is a collection of
stories of the past – a past so different from today that it has become
irrelevant, or a collection of nice thoughts, but with little power to
impact their lives for good. With what seems little reason to read or
study it, why bother?

In this passage, Paul highlights three valuable outcomes of reading and
attending to God’s Word, offered as gracious gifts to sustain us in the
challenges we face in our lives. Life can be hard, yet God cares for us
in the midst of our hard times, and in His Word we can find what we need
to survive. Paul says that whatever was written in former days (the
Scriptures) was written to instruct and benefit us. He then focuses on
three outcomes from being instructed by God’s Word: endurance,
encouragement, and hope.

*Endurance.* The Old Testament offers many examples of people in
difficult circumstances who learned to endure and wait for God’s help.
Abraham and Sarah endured years of barrenness, hoping for a child;
Joseph endured years in prison before being freed; Daniel and his
companions endured years of service in Babylon and threats on their
lives; Ruth endured poverty with her mother-in-law, Naomi. In the New
Testament we see further examples: Jesus endured the cross for our sake;
Paul was stoned and imprisoned multiple times during his ministry; and
John was exiled to the island of Patmos for his faith. God gives us His
Word, that we might read of others who followed after God and endured
many challenges.

*Encouragement.* These stories from the past do something even more
important than setting an example of endurance that we can imitate. They
encourage us. We may be tempted to despair, to give up, but as we see
God working in their situations to sustain and help them endure, it
encourages us to trust God and to persevere in our own difficult
situations. These stories encourage our hearts.

*Hope.* Ultimately, the examples from Scripture, and God’s promises to
be with us in our struggles, give us hope. Hope grows in us as we read
how God worked in the lives of others, and shows us that God is still
present, still powerful, still able to sustain us, just as He sustained
others in the past. This blossoming hope strengthens us to endure the
hardships we face because we know they are not the end of the story. Our
hope rests in God, both in this life and in the life to come.

As someone leading a Bible study, I encourage you to consider how your
own reading and study of the Scriptures is impacting your heart. Is it
encouraging you, sustaining you, giving you hope, helping you endure
challenges and hard situations? If not, take time to pray before you
read and study, asking God to help you see examples and truths that
*can* encourage your heart. God *wants* to encourage you and give you
*hope*. As you lead your study, do you try to help others see God’s
gracious care in the Scriptures? Do you help them to be encouraged by
what you have read together, and have hope in their own challenges? It
may help to be intentional in your prayer time together, to focus on
specific aspects you have studied that encourage and give you hope, and
then praise and give thanks to God for them. Ultimately, that is where
this passage ends – that together with one voice we may glorify the God
and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. Encouragement and hope of this kind
leads us to worship God, trust Him with our present situations, and
praise Him for His encouragement. I pray this will increasingly become
the fruit of your study together.

> *Father, I am so grateful for Your Word, and the examples and
> teachings in it that encourage my heart and give me hope when I am in
> difficult circumstances. Thank You for the assurances that You are
> with me and able to sustain me as I trust and follow You. As I lead my
> Bible study, please help me share my own hope in You, and help others
> see in Your Word reasons for encouragement and hope that can help them
> endure whatever hard situations they may face. Together we will give
> You praise and thanks. May You be glorified in all we do and say!
> Amen.*
