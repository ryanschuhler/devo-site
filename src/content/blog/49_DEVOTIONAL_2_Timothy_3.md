#DEVOTIONAL 49

**The Power of the Scripture**

> *You, however, have followed my teaching, my conduct, my aim in life,
> my faith, my patience, my love, my steadfastness, my persecutions and
> sufferings that happened to me at Antioch, at Iconium, and at
> Lystra—which persecutions I endured; yet from them all the Lord
> rescued me. Indeed, all who desire to live a godly life in Christ
> Jesus will be persecuted, while evil people and impostors will go on
> from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived. But as for you,
> continue in what you have learned and have firmly believed, knowing
> from whom you learned it and how from childhood you have been
> acquainted with the sacred writings, which are able to make you wise
> for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. All Scripture is breathed
> out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction,
> and for training in righteousness, that the man of God may be
> complete, equipped for every good work.* (2 Timothy 3:10-17, ESV)

**M**ore than once in this collection of devotions, I’ve encouraged you
to remember those who discipled you, taught you the Bible, and
encouraged your growth in Christ. Let’s do this one more time: Think
about who had the deepest impact on your spiritual growth as they
discipled you. What were they like? How did they relate to you and to
others? What were their life goals? What was their faith like? How did
they express their love for you? How did they bear up when faced with
challenges in their lives? No one is perfect, and we don’t want to put
someone on a pedestal, but it is good to remember the type of people God
used for our own growth. A few come to mind from my college days, and I
am eternally grateful for their loving ministry with me. They powerfully
demonstrate the importance of who we are as Bible study leaders, not
just the soundness of the content we teach.

Paul writes from prison to Timothy, knowing there will be teachers who
will attempt to deceive the church in Ephesus. These false teachers are
self-deceived, and if Timothy and others in the church are not careful,
these teachers will undermine the gospel message and lead the church
astray. Paul urges Timothy to remain true to what he learned and has
believed, offering a two-fold reason. As I read this again recently, I
realized that too often I skip over the first reason Paul gives and move
straight to the second. It’s easy to do, but in doing so, we miss
something important.

Let’s start with the second reason, which is the nature and power of the
Scriptures for our instruction and salvation. This is a much-loved
passage, and I’ve repeatedly read and heard others quote it as
foundational for our Bible study ministries. These “sacred writings” are
able to lead us to salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. Their source
is God (“breathed out”), and they show us where are wrong in our
understanding or behavior, show us what we need to know and do, guide us
in learning to live in greater obedience to God, and help us grow to
maturity in our walk with God, equipped for the good works God has
prepared ahead of time for us to accomplish (Ephesians 2:10). Paul
encourages Timothy to put his confidence in the Scriptures and use them
as a foundation, both for his own teaching and for evaluating others’
teaching. Our own confidence still remains in the Scriptures today,
which is why we study the Bible together.

But, back to Paul’s first reason—much more personal. He urges Timothy to
continue in what he has learned and firmly believed, because he “knows”
who he learned it from. This “knowing” Paul describes is not mere
surface knowledge of who Paul is, but a deep knowledge of the kind of
person Paul has become by the grace of God. Timothy knows not only what
Paul has taught, but in spending time with Paul, knows the integrity of
his conduct with others and his life aim of obedience to God in
witnessing to the Gentiles. He knows Paul’s history--faith in Christ
that came after God’s gracious intervention while Paul was an enemy of
the gospel. He has seen Paul’s patience, love, and steadfastness, even
when he suffered persecution for the sake of proclaiming the gospel. And
Timothy knows how God rescued Paul, time and time again, from
persecution, and how God guided Paul in his missionary journeys. Paul’s
life adds credibility to his teaching and is not to be lightly set aside
when some new teacher comes in with a different message than what Paul
taught.

Ultimately, the truthfulness of our teaching rests on how well we
understand and respond to God’s Word. Using the reference point of
Scripture, we evaluate what any Bible teacher or preacher says. “Sola
Scriptura” has been foundational to guiding ministry from the beginning.
But our lives also impact those we teach. We can add credibility to our
message because of God’s transforming work in our own lives, or we can
undermine our message because of our misconduct or hypocrisy. Because
Timothy knew Paul well, Paul could encourage him to remember the kind of
person he was and how God had worked in his life. Paul demonstrated
integrity and consistency between his message and his life, thus adding
credibility to his teaching.

How about you? Have you shared God’s work of transformation in your own
life? Have you patiently loved those you have led in Bible study so that
they can see consistency between your message and your life? Are your
lifestyle and relationships with others a testimony to the truthfulness
of what you teach? None of us are perfect in this regard, but we must be
able to show a good measure of God’s transforming work in our lives to
add credibility to our ministries. Without the credibility created by
“walking our talk”, it is too easy for others to dismiss what we say.
May God help you see any areas where you need His help to live out your
faith more consistently, for your own sake and for those you lead.

> *Father, I am grateful for your transforming work in my own life.
> Thank you for your grace in accepting me in Christ, and your grace
> that works within me to grow me more into His likeness and character.
> May your work within me be a testimony to the truthfulness of what
> your Scripture teaches. Thank you for the power of your Word to
> correct me, teach me, and train me toward Christlikeness. Help me to
> teach your Word well, both in what I say and how I live. Amen.*
