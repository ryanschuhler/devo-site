**Having the Mind of Christ**

**B**efore I came to faith in Christ there were parts of the Bible that
I did not especially like, and I resisted some aspects of what I
understood it to say. Some parts, like those dealing with love and being
forgiven, were appealing. But other parts that spoke of judgment for
sin, or forgiving others, were not so appealing. It was less a case of
my not understanding what the Bible said, but more my not valuing it,
appreciating it, or accepting it. Even as a new Christian, I did not
automatically welcome all that the Bible said. I knew I had important
things to learn, but I still resisted some directives that challenged
how I lived my life. My heart perspective and attitude acted as a filter
that allowed me to receive some teachings, but made it harder to
recognize or receive others. As Paul explains in this letter, I’m not
alone in this experience.

Earlier in this chapter, Paul has been describing how his teaching
ministry was not dependent on his own wisdom or ability to skillfully
craft words, but rather on the power of God, demonstrated in Christ’s
crucifixion and resurrection, and as the Holy Spirit works within us to
instruct us. Paul did not want his hearers to accept his teaching
because of his own cleverness, but because God was at work, and his
teaching was ultimately from God. But Paul also recognized that without
the Holy Spirit’s help, his hearers may not be open to or accept this
teaching from God, thinking it to be foolishness, not wisdom. The issue
was not a matter of being smart enough to understand it, but rather,
being open enough to God’s work within them to help them see the value
and importance of what Paul was teaching them. On their own, it just did
not make good sense to them.

When we teach, it is tempting to think that, if we can just find the
right way to say something, we’ll get our point across, and our students
will be open to and accept what we’re teaching. In reality, however, for
someone to accept the message of Scripture, that person’s heart must be
humble and teachable, open to God, and open to the work of the Spirit
who helps them to see how good and important the message actually is.
Without God’s help, our hearers can easily reject the Scripture message
we share as foolishness, unwise, and unwelcome. The Holy Spirit’s work
within people can open them up to the Scriptures in a way that God uses
to transform them.

So, what does this mean for me as a teacher? I have come to understand
that doing my best to prepare my Bible studies well is still important,
but the true, lasting impact of anything I teach depends both on the
wisdom of God shown in the Scriptures and in the work of the Spirit in
the lives of those I teach. Learners whose hearts are not tuned to the
wisdom of God can resist and devalue good teaching, resulting in no
lasting life impact. But when the learner is open to the Spirit’s work,
receptivity grows. So, along with preparing my Bible studies well, I
need to pray for those I teach, that their hearts would be open to the
Holy Spirit’s drawing them to faith in Christ, and enabling them to
recognize and welcome God’s wisdom as we study His Word together. I also
must be patient and loving with those I teach, recognizing how difficult
it can be for some to accept what they are reading or hearing. I can
empathize with them, remembering my own similar struggles.

As you teach, keep in mind your own past struggles to understand and
accept different aspects of the Bible’s teaching. Pray for those you
teach, that the Holy Spirit would be at work to help them receive the
Scripture lesson and to be open to God’s work of transformation. Be
patient with those who resist or dismiss what you teach, remembering
your own similar challenges. Finally, be thankful for the work of the
Holy Spirit within you and within those you teach, recognizing that He
is our teacher and transformer, that the power of teaching and learning
rests with His work within us!

> Amen.*
